>When you start, think @ this -
	-Everytime I get the tweets by searching the movie name, I get only 200.
	So we need more data. Or probably I need to collect data over a long period of time.
	
	Or I should use "since" parameter?

	-Out of 200 tweets that I get, many are "repeated" since it is 1 tweet being RT'ed.
	Thus out of 200 only 130-140 might be unique!

	-I searched "considerably" to get twitter movie data for training, didn't find.
	All I get is - movie reviews, which I'm not sure is a correct data to train the classifier.

		>Perhaps I should get a lot of tweets over a period of time & then label them manually 
		into  - +ve / -ve & neutral.
		> "neutral" class is very imp : Bcoz many of the tweets are - Watching XYZ movie  with P, Q, & R at ABC.


	-I didnt do any "cleaning"/pre-processing of the tweets b4 using it for training!
	( Too desperate to first see some results! ) 
	So do that!

	-Another way out could be : for training use just a list of +ve/-ve words.
	And then directly feed the processed tweets to the classifier.
