films
adapted
from
comic
books
have
had
plenty
of
success
,
whether
they
'
re
about
superheroes
(
batman
,
superman
,
spawn
)
,
or
geared
toward
kids
(
casper
)
or
the
arthouse
crowd
(
ghost
world
)
,
but
there
'
s
never
really
been
a
comic
book
like
from
hell
before
.
for
starters
,
it
was
created
by
alan
moore
(
and
eddie
campbell
)
,
who
brought
the
medium
to
a
whole
new
level
in
the
mid
'
80s
with
a
12
-
part
series
called
the
watchmen
.
to
say
moore
and
campbell
thoroughly
researched
the
subject
of
jack
the
ripper
would
be
like
saying
michael
jackson
is
starting
to
look
a
little
odd
.
the
book
(
or
"
graphic
novel
,
"
if
you
will
)
is
over
500
pages
long
and
includes
nearly
30
more
that
consist
of
nothing
but
footnotes
.
in
other
words
,
don
'
t
dismiss
this
film
because
of
its
source
.
if
you
can
get
past
the
whole
comic
book
thing
,
you
might
find
another
stumbling
block
in
from
hell
'
s
directors
,
albert
and
allen
hughes
.
getting
the
hughes
brothers
to
direct
this
seems
almost
as
ludicrous
as
casting
carrot
top
in
,
well
,
anything
,
but
riddle
me
this
:
who
better
to
direct
a
film
that
'
s
set
in
the
ghetto
and
features
really
violent
street
crime
than
the
mad
geniuses
behind
menace
ii
society
?
the
ghetto
in
question
is
,
of
course
,
whitechapel
in
1888
london
'
s
east
end
.
it
'
s
a
filthy
,
sooty
place
where
the
whores
(
called
"
unfortunates
"
)
are
starting
to
get
a
little
nervous
about
this
mysterious
psychopath
who
has
been
carving
through
their
profession
with
surgical
precision
.
when
the
first
stiff
turns
up
,
copper
peter
godley
(
robbie
coltrane
,
the
world
is
not
enough
)
calls
in
inspector
frederick
abberline
(
johnny
depp
,
blow
)
to
crack
the
case
.
abberline
,
a
widower
,
has
prophetic
dreams
he
unsuccessfully
tries
to
quell
with
copious
amounts
of
absinthe
and
opium
.
upon
arriving
in
whitechapel
,
he
befriends
an
unfortunate
named
mary
kelly
(
heather
graham
,
say
it
isn
'
t
so
)
and
proceeds
to
investigate
the
horribly
gruesome
crimes
that
even
the
police
surgeon
can
'
t
stomach
.
i
don
'
t
think
anyone
needs
to
be
briefed
on
jack
the
ripper
,
so
i
won
'
t
go
into
the
particulars
here
,
other
than
to
say
moore
and
campbell
have
a
unique
and
interesting
theory
about
both
the
identity
of
the
killer
and
the
reasons
he
chooses
to
slay
.
in
the
comic
,
they
don
'
t
bother
cloaking
the
identity
of
the
ripper
,
but
screenwriters
terry
hayes
(
vertical
limit
)
and
rafael
yglesias
(
les
mis
?
rables
)
do
a
good
job
of
keeping
him
hidden
from
viewers
until
the
very
end
.
it
'
s
funny
to
watch
the
locals
blindly
point
the
finger
of
blame
at
jews
and
indians
because
,
after
all
,
an
englishman
could
never
be
capable
of
committing
such
ghastly
acts
.
and
from
hell
'
s
ending
had
me
whistling
the
stonecutters
song
from
the
simpsons
for
days
(
"
who
holds
back
the
electric
car
/
who
made
steve
guttenberg
a
star
?
"
)
.
don
'
t
worry
-
it
'
ll
all
make
sense
when
you
see
it
.
now
onto
from
hell
'
s
appearance
:
it
'
s
certainly
dark
and
bleak
enough
,
and
it
'
s
surprising
to
see
how
much
more
it
looks
like
a
tim
burton
film
than
planet
of
the
apes
did
(
at
times
,
it
seems
like
sleepy
hollow

)
.
the
print
i
saw
wasn
'
t
completely
finished
(
both
color
and
music
had
not
been
finalized
,
so
no
comments
about
marilyn
manson
)
,
but
cinematographer
peter
deming
(
don
'
t
say
a
word
)
ably
captures
the
dreariness
of
victorian
-
era
london
and
helped
make
the
flashy
killing
scenes
remind
me
of
the
crazy
flashbacks
in
twin
peaks
,
even
though
the
violence
in
the
film
pales
in
comparison
to
that
in
the

the
dark

is
that
,
because
expectations
were
so
low

the

how
is
it
that
an

contain
so
many

points

both

were
probably

thing

been
bothering
me
since
i
'

seen

there
is
an
extraordinary
amount
of
sexuality
in
this
film

i
suppose
that
,
coming
from
mtv
films
,
i
should
expect
no
less
.
.
.
but
the
film
starts
off
light
and
airy
,
like
a
sitcom
.
as
the
screws
tighten
,
and
the
tensions
mount
,
alexander

decides
to
add
elements
that
,
frankly
,
distract
from

it
is
bad
enough
that

doesn

t
like
tracy
'
s
determination

win
at
all
costs
,
but
did
they
have
to
throw
in
the
student
/
teacher

?
even
so
,
there
'
s
no
logical
reason
why
mr

an

there
'
s
a
lot
to
like

the
plot
similarities
to

,
and
the
tonal
nosedive
it
takes
as
it
gets
explicitly

-
driven
,
mark
this
as
a
disappointment

works
alot
better
than
it
deserves
to
.
in
order
to
make
the
film
a
success
,
all
they
had
to
do
was
cast
two
extremely
popular
and
attractive
stars
,
have
them
share
the
screen
for
about
two
hours
and
then
collect
the
profits
.
no
real
acting
was
involved
and
there
is
not
an
original
or
inventive
bone
in
it
'
s
body
(
it
'
s
basically
a
complete
re
-
shoot
of
the
shop
around
the
corner
,
only
adding
a
few
modern
twists
)
.
essentially
,
it
goes
against
and
defies
all
concepts
of
good
contemporary
filmmaking
.
it
'
s
overly
sentimental
and
at
times
terribly
mushy
,
not
to
mention
very
manipulative
.
but
oh
,
how
enjoyable
that
manipulation
is
.
but
there
must
be
something
other
than
the
casting
and
manipulation
that
makes
the
movie
work
as
well
as
it
does
,
because
i
absolutely
hated
the
previous
ryan
/
hanks
teaming
,
sleepless
in
seattle
.
it
couldn
'
t
have
been
the
directing
,
because
both
films
were
helmed
by
the
same
woman
.
i
haven
'
t
quite
yet
figured
out
what
i
liked
so
much
about
you
'
ve
got
mail
,
but
then
again
,
is
that
really
important
?
if
you
like
something
so
much
,
why
even
question
it
?
again
,
the
storyline
is
as
cliched
as
they
come
.
tom
hanks
plays
joe
fox
,
the
insanely
likeable
owner
of
a
discount
book
chain
and
meg
ryan
plays
kathleen
kelley
,
the
even
more
insanely
likeable
proprietor
of
a
family
-
run
children
'
s
book
shop
called
,
in
a
nice
homage
,
the
shop
around
the
corner
.
fox
and
kelley
soon
become
bitter
rivals
because
the
new
fox
books
store
is
opening
up
right
across
the
block
from
the
small
business
.
little
do
they
know
,
they
are
already
in
love
with
each
other
over
the
internet
,
only
neither
party
knows
the
other
person
'
s
true
identity
.
the
rest
of
the
story
isn
'
t
important
because
all
it
does
is
serve
as
a
mere
backdrop
for
the
two
stars
to
share
the
screen
.
sure
,
there
are
some
mildly
interesting
subplots
,
but
they
all
fail
in
comparison
to
the
utter
cuteness
of
the
main
relationship
.
all
of
this
,
of
course
,
leads
up
to
the
predictable
climax
.
but
as
foreseeable
as
the
ending
is
,
it
'
s
so
damn
cute
and
well
-
done
that
i
doubt
any
movie
in
the
entire
year
contains
a
scene
the
evokes
as
much
pure
joy
as
this
part
does
.
when
ryan
discovers
the
true
identity
of
her
online
love
,
i
was
filled
with
such
,
for
lack
of
a
better
word
,
happiness
that
for
the
first
time
all
year
,
i
actually
left
the
theater
smiling

"
jaws
"
is
a
rare
film
that
grabs
your
attention
before
it
shows
you
a
single
image
on
screen
.
the
movie
opens
with
blackness
,
and
only
distant
,
alien
-
like
underwater
sounds
.
then
it
comes
,
the
first
ominous
bars
of
composer
john
williams
'
now
infamous
score
.
dah
-
dum
.
from
there
,
director
steven
spielberg
wastes
no
time
,
taking
us
into
the
water
on
a
midnight
swim
with
a
beautiful
girl
that
turns
deadly
.
right
away
he
lets
us
know
how
vulnerable
we
all
are
floating
in
the
ocean
,
and
once
"
jaws
"
has
attacked
,
it
never
relinquishes
its
grip
.
perhaps
what
is
most
outstanding
about
"
jaws
"
is
how
spielberg
builds
the
movie
.
he
works
it
like
a
theatrical
production
,
with
a
first
act
and
a
second
act
.
unlike
so
many
modern
filmmakers
,
he
has
a
great
deal
of
restraint
,
and
refuses
to
show
us
the
shark
until
the
middle
of
the
second
act
.
until
then
,
he
merely
suggests
its
presence
with
creepy
,
subjective
underwater
shots
and
williams
'
music
.
he
'
s
building
the
tension
bit
by
bit
,
so
when
it
comes
time
for
the
climax
,
the
shark
'
s
arrival
is
truly
terrifying
.
he
doesn
'
t
let
us
get
bored
with
the
imagery
.
the
first
act
opens
with
police
chief
martin
brody
(
roy
scheider
)
,
a
new
york
cop
who
has
taken
an
easy
,
peaceful
job
running
the
police
station
on
amity
island
,
a
fictitious
new
england
resort
town
where
there
hasn
'
t
been
a
murder
or
a
gun
fired
in
25
years
.
the
island
is
shaken
up
by
several
vicious
great
white
shark
attacks
right
before
the
fourth
of
july
,
and
the
mayor
,
larry
vaughn
(
murray
hamilton
)
,
doesn
'
t
want
to
shut
down
the
beaches
because
the
island
is
reliant
on
summer
tourist
money
.
brody
is
joined
by
matt
hooper
(
richard
dreyfuss
)
,
a
young
,
ambitious
shark
expert
from
the
marine
institute
.
hooper
is
as
fascinated
by
the
shark
as
he
is
determined
to
help
brody
stop
it
--
his
knowledge
about
the
exact
workings
of
the
shark
(
"
it
'
s
a
perfect
engine
,
an
eating
machine
"
)
make
it
that
much
more
terrifying
.
when
vaughn
finally
relents
,
hooper
and
brody
join
a
crusty
old
shark
killer
named
quint
(
robert
shaw
)
on
his
decrepit
boat
,
the
orca
,
to
search
for
the
shark
.
the
entire
second
act
takes
place
on
the
orca
as
the
three
men
hunt
the
shark
,
and
inevitably
,
are
hunted
by
it
.
"
jaws
"
is
a
thriller
with

keen
sense
of

an
incredible
sense

pacing
,
tension
,
and
horror
.
it
is
like
ten
movies
all
rolled
into
one
,
and
it
'
s
no
wonder
it
took
america
by
storm
in
the
summer
of
1975
,
taking
in
enough
money
to
crown
it
the
box
office
champ
of
all
time
(
until
it
was
unceremoniously
dethroned
in
1977
by
"
star
wars
"
)
.
even
today
,
fascination
with
this
film
is
on
par
with
hitchcock
'
s
"
psycho
,
"
and
it
never
seems
to
age
.
although
grand
new
technology
exists
that
makes
the
technical
sequences
,
including
several
mechanical
sharks
,
obsolete
,
none
of
it
could
improve
the
film
because
it
only
would
lead
to
overkill
.
the
technical
limitations
faced
by
spielberg
in
1975
may
have
actually
produced
a
better
film
because
it
forced
him
to
rely
on
traditional
cinematic
elements
like
pacing
,
characterization
,
sharp
editing
,
and
creative
photography
,
instead
of
simply
dousing
the
audience
with
digital
shark
effects
.
scheider
,
dreyfuss
,
and
shaw
were
known
actors
at
the
time
"
jaws
"
was
made
,
but
none
of
them
had
the
draw
of
a
robert
redford
or
paul
newman
.
nevertheless
,
this
film
guaranteed
them
all
successful
careers
because
each
gave
an
outstanding
performance
and
refused
to
be
overshadowed
by
the
shark
.
scheider
hits
just
the
right
notes
as
a
sympathetic
husband
and
father
caught
in
the
political
quagmire
of
doing
what
'
s
right
and
going
against
the
entire
town
.
"
it

your
first
summer

dreyfuss

who
had
previously
been
seen
in

"
(
1973
)
and
"
the
apprenticeship
of
duddy
kravitz
"
(
1974
)
gives
a
surprisingly
mature
,
complex
performance
for
someone
who
had
literally
only
played
kids
and
teenagers
.
however
,
most
outstanding
is
the
gnarled
performance
by
robert
shaw
as
the
movie
'
s
captain
ahab
,
a
performance
sorely
overlooked
by
the
academy
awards
.
bordering
of
parody
,
shaw
plays
quint
as
a
grizzled
old
loner
whose
machismo
borders
on
masochism
.
he
'
s
slightly
deranged
,
and
shaw
'
s
performance
is
almost
a
caricature
.
however
,
there
is
one
scene
late
in
the
film
,
when
he
and
brody
and
hooper
are
below
deck
on
the
orca
comparing

of
sharks
slowly
devoured

actually
more
hair

raising
than
anything
spielberg
put
on
screen
.
shaw
delivers
the
story
in
one
long
take
,
and
it
is
the
best
acting
in
the
film
.
of
course
,
we
can
'
t
leave
out
the
shark
itself
;
with
its
black
eyes
,
endless
rows
of
teeth
,
and
insatiable
urge
to
eat
,
it
is
basically
the
epitome
of
all
mankind
'
s
fears
about
what
is
unknown
and
threatening
in
nature
.
a
shark
is
such
a
perfect
nemesis
it
is
real
--
having
survived
sinch
the
dinosaurs
,
great
whites
do
exist
,
they
can
be
as
large
as
the
shark
in
"
jaws
,
"
and
they
are
a
threat
.
every
one
of
spielberg
'
s
subjective
underwater
shots
makes
us
feel
queasy
because
lets
us
see
how
we
look
to
the
shark
:
a
bunch
of
writihing
,
dangling
,
completely
unprotected
legs
just
ready
to
be
chomped
into
.
the
shark
in
"
jaws
"
was
actually
a
combination
of
actual
footage
and
five
different
mechanical
sharks
(
all
nicknamed
"
bruce
"
by
the
crew
)
built
to
be
shot
from
different
angles
.
many
have
forgotten
,
but
"
jaws
"
was
a
sort
of
precursor
to
"
waterworld
"
(
1995
)
,
a
movie
'
s
who
soggy
production
and
cost
overruns
had
universal
studios
worried
about
a
bomb
.
but
,
as
we
can
see
now
,
spielberg
overcame
all
the
obstacles
,
and
delivered
one
of
the
finest
primal
scare
-
thrillers
ever
to
come
out
of
hollywood
.
moviemaking
is
a
lot
like
being
the
general
manager
of
an
nfl
team
in
the
post
-
salary
cap
era
--
you
'
ve
got
to
know
how
to
allocate
your
resources
.
every
dollar
spent
on
a
free
-
agent
defensive
tackle
is
one
less
dollar
than
you
can
spend
on
linebackers
or
safeties
or
centers
.
in
the
nfl
,
this
leads
to
teams
like
the
detroit
lions
,
who
boast
a
superstar
running
back
with
a
huge
contract
,
but
can
only
field
five
guys
named
herb
to
block
for
him
.
in
the
movies
,
you
end
up
with
films
like
"
spawn
"
,
with
a
huge
special
-
effects
budget
but
not
enough
money
to
hire
any
recognizable
actors
.
jackie
chan
is
the
barry
sanders
of
moviemaking
.
he
spins
and
darts
across
the
screen
like
sanders
cutting
back
through
the
defensive
line
.
watching
jackie
in
operation
condor
as
he
drives
his
motorcycle
through
the
crowded
streets
of
madrid
,
fleeing
an
armada
of
pursuers
in
identical
black
compact
cars
,
is
reminiscent
of
sanders
running
for
daylight
with
the
chicago
bears
in
hot
pursuit
,
except
that
sanders
doesn
'
t
have
to
worry
about
rescuing
runaway
baby
carriages
.
but
like
the
lions
star
,
jackie
doesn
'
t
have
anybody
to
block
for
him
.
almost
every
cent
that
'
s
invested
in
a
jackie
chan
movie
goes
for
stunts
,
and
as
chan
does
his
own
stunts
,
the
rest
of
the
money
goes
to
pay
his
hospital
bills
.
this
leaves
about
75
cents
to
pay
for
things
like
directors
(
chan
directs
)
,
scripts
and
dubbing
and
supporting
characters
,
not
to
mention
the
hideous
title
sequence
.
this
also
explains
why
the
movie
was
shot
in
odd
places
like
morocco
and
spain
.
(
chan
'
s
first
release
in
this
country
,
"
rumble
in
the
bronx
"
,
was
supposedly
set
in
new
york
,
but
was
filmed
in
vancouver
,
and
in
the
chase
scenes
the
canadian
rockies
are
clearly
visible
.
)
heck
,
jackie
doesn
'
t
even
have
enough
money
for
a
haircut
,
looks
like
,
much
less
a
personal
hairstylist
.
in
condor
,
chan
plays
the
same
character
he
'
s
always
played
,
himself
,
a
mixture
of
bruce
lee
and
tim
allen
,
a
master
of
both
kung
-
fu
and
slapstick
-
fu
.
jackie
is
sent
by
the
un
to
retrieve
a
cache
of
lost
nazi
gold
in
the
north
african
desert
,
and
is
chased
by
a
horde
of
neo
-
nazi
sympathizers
and
two
stereotypical
arabs
(
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
jackie
chan
movies
:
no
political
correctness
)
.
he
is
joined
by
three
women
,
who
have
little
to
do
except
scream
,
"
jackie
,
save
us
!
"
,
and
misuse
firearms
.
the
villain
is
an
old
nazi
whose
legs
were
broken
in
the
secret
base
so
that
he
has
to
be
carried
everywhere
,
and
he
'
s
more
pathetic
than
evil
.
en
route
,
we
have
an
extended
motorcycle
chase
scene
,
a
hilarious
fight
in
the
moroccan
version
of
motel
6
with
the
neo
-
nazis
,
and
two
confrontations
with
savage
natives
.
once
at
the
secret
desert

,
there
is
a
long
chop
-
socky
sequence
,
followed
by
the
film
'
s
centerpiece
,
a
wind
-
tunnel
fight
that
'
s
even
better
than
the
one
in

off

this
is
where
the
money
was
spent

on

sequences
,
on

balls
,
on

and
on

ignore
the
gaping
holes
in
the
plot
(
how
,
exactly
,
if
the
villain

legs
were
broken
,
did
he
escape
from

and
why
didn

just

operation
condor
has
pretentions
of
being
a
"
raiders
of
the
lost
ark
"
knockoff
,
but
one
wonders
what
jackie
could
do
with
the
raiders
franchise
blocking
for
him
--
with
a
lawrence
kazdan
screenplay
,
a
john
williams
score
,
spielberg
directing
and
george
lucas
producing
,
condor
might
be
an
a
+
movie
.
however
,
you
'
ve
got
to
go
with
what
you
'
ve
got
,
and
what
you
'
ve
got
in
jackie
chan
is
something
special
--
a
talent
that
mainstream
hollywood
should
,
could
,
and
ought
to
utilize
.
on
june
30
,
1960
,
a
self
-
taught
,
idealistic
,
yet
pragmatic
,
young
man
became
,
at
age
36
,
the
first
head
of
government
of
a
newly
independent
african
state
,
formerly
the
belgian
congo
.
two
months
later
,
he
was
ousted
from
his
powerful
position
and
hunted
by
government
troops
until
he
was
captured
and
brutally
murdered
along
with
two
aides
.
this
little
-
known
story
of
this
meteoric
rise
and
fall
is
told
my
international
filmmaker
raoul
peck
in
"
lumumba
.
"
patrice
lumumba
'
s
(
eriq
ebouaney
)
story
has
been
told
previously
by
helmer
peck
in
his
1991
award
winning
documentary
,
"
lumumba
-
death
of
a
prophet
,
"
virtually
guaranteeing
that
his
new
,
fictional
account
of
a
patriot
remains
true
to
its
subject
.
peck
,
with
co
-
writer
pascal
bonitzer
,
begins
at
the
end
of
the
story
of
the
young
political
leader
.
we
watch
as
two
white
men
perform
the
gruesome
task
of
dismembering
the
bodies
of
three
black
men
.
images
of
hatchets
,
saws
and
fast
-
emptying
whiskey
bottles
accompany
the
grisly
image
.
jump
back
a
few
years
to
a
meeting
among
the
black
leaders
in
the
belgian
-
owned
congo
.
a
third
class
postal
worker
,
lumumba
,
speaks
his
mind
to
heads
of
the
most
powerful
tribes
,
proclaiming
himself
not
tribal
,
not
regional
,
but
a
national
leader
.
his
small
,
mobile
party
,
the
congolese
national
movement
(
mnc
)
is
gaining
prominence
and
patrice
leaves
his
clerical
job
to
sell
beer
,
and
get
his
face
known
,
in
the
bustling
capital
,
stanleyville
.
at
a
time
when
the
colonial
empires
are
falling
down
around
the
world
,
lumumba
is
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
,
through
political
savvy
and
chess
-
like
manipulation
,
achieves
a
position
of
leadership
of
the
mnc
.
as
the
date
for
independence
approaches
,
he
tactically
positions
himself
to
be
the
new
nation
'
s
first
prime
minister
and
defense
minister
,
supporting
the
presidency
of
joseph
kasa
vubu
(
maka
kotto
)
.
the
coalition
he
created
soon
starts
to
fall
apart
as
the
former
belgian
masters
continue
to
exert
influence
on
the
struggling
nation
as
they
strive
to
maintain
economic
hold
on
the
country
'
s
vast
natural
resources
of
copper
,
diamonds
,
gold
and
more
.
lumumba
won
'
t
seek
the
help
of
the
us
,
knowing
that
they
would
try
to
create
de
facto
american
control
of
the
fledgling
government
.
his
initial
investigation
into
soviet
assistance
immediately
tags
patrice
as
a
communist
and
his
integrity
is
overshadowed
by
the
cold
war
threat
of
russian
domination
.
the
situation
goes
from
bad
to
worse
as
the
army
mutinies
,
the
remaining
whites
begin
to
evacuate
or
arm
themselves
,
belgian
troops
violently
intervene
,
the
lucrative
katanga
province
succeeds
under
the
leadership
of
rival
moise
tschombe
(
pascal
nzonzi
)
and
lumumba
is
refused
access
to
his
own
country
when
he
returns
from
a
conference
abroad
.
this
tumultuous
and
little
known
period
of
modern
african
history
saw
a
score
of
nations
struggling
for
independence
from
the
sometimes
-
odious
colonialists
who
have
ruled
much
of
the
world
from
their
european
seats
of
power
for
centuries
.
peck
focuses
his
story
on
familiar
material
that
strives
to
give
an
honest
portrayal
of
patrice
lumumba
,
his
friend
and
foes
and
the
independence
movements
that
gripped
africa
in
the
50
'
s
and
60
'
s
.
(
during
the
time
the
story
takes
place
,
many
new
nations
,
including
nigeria
and
somalia
,
were
born
,
with
varying
degrees
of
success
and
failure
,
usually
dependent
upon
which
country
colonized
them
.
some
colonial
masters
were
better
than
others
.
)
the
effort
involved
in
"
lumumba
"
is
quite
ambitious
as
peck
and
his
crew
before
and
behind
the
camera
strive
to
bring
to
life
this
slice
of
world
history
that
might
have
gone
unexplored
for
decades
,
if
at
all
.
production
values
are
first
rate
on
what
must
be
a
small
,
by
us
standards
,
budget
.
the
period
feel
and
realistic
african
settings
are
nicely
maintained
in
a
production
that
traveled
from
zimbabwe
to
mozambique
.
the
screenplay
covers
a
lot
of
ground
and
does
yeoman
'
s
work
in
providing
a
great
deal
of
detailed
history
while
trying
to
do
justice
to
the
story
of
lumumba
'
s
life
.
the
political
side
of
things
is
evenly
told
in
a
linear
,
straightforward
manner
that
teaches
,
not
preaches
.
it
concentrates
on
the
good
deeds
of
the
man
,
if
a
bit
as
a
stalwart
saint
,
but
doesn
'
t
embellish
on
a
larger
than
life
persona
.
the
family
side
of
patrice
'
s
life
is
handled
in
several
,
perfunctory
and
brief
interludes
that
show
him
talking
to
one
of
his
children
,
embracing
his
wife
or
lamenting
the
death
of
his
child
.
i
know
the
intent
is
to
flesh
the
man
out
,
but
too
short
a
shrift
is
given
to
the
family
man
side
of
lumumba
.
the
story
,
as
such
,
has
a
lopsided
feel
about
it
.
high
marks
go
to
eriq
ebouaney
as
the
title
character
.
the
actor
gives
a
convincing
,
charismatic
performance
as
the
multifaceted
,
politically
deft
patrice
lumumba
who
has
the
good
of
his
people
and
his
country
as
the
force
driving
his
own
ambitions
.
in
true
docudrama
tradition
,
the
supporting
cast
does
not
outshine
the
star
,
complementing
his
good
efforts
,
instead
.
"
lumumba
"
is
a
solid
,
interesting
,
educational
and
honest
docudrama
that
should
appeal
to
film
buffs
and
politicos
,
both
.
it
has
more
intelligence
in
its
telling
than
anything
i
'
ve
seen
out
of
hollywood
for
months
and
i
give
it
a
b

.
apparently
,
director
tony
kaye
had
a
major
battle
with
new
line
regarding
his
new
film
,
american
history
x
.
i
don
'
t
know
the
details
of
the
fight
,
but
it
seems
that
he
is
not
happy
with
the
final
product
,
and
nearly
removed
his
name
from
the
credits
altogether
.
i
'
ve
heard
about
this
kind
of
thing
happening
before
,
and
it
makes
me
wonder
how
much
input
a
studio
has
over
the
films
they
produce
.
as
it
is
,
i
found
american
history
x
to
be
an
extremely
good
film
,
not
just
because
of
tony

focused
look
at
the
touchy
subject
of
racism
,
but
because
of
a
powerful
,
charismatic
performance
from
edward
norton
.
it
'
s
hard
to
believe
that
it
has
only
been
two
years
since
norton
'
s
fantastic
role
in
primal
fear
,
but
,
here
he
is
now
,
starring
in
his
own
film
and
making
himself
a
star
.
norton
is
one
of
those
performers
who
becomes
his
character
,
and
his
work
in
american
history
x
is
one
of
the
very
best
performances
this
year
.
he
plays
a
young
man
named
derek
vinyard
,
a
skinhead
living
in
venice
beach
with
his
brother
,
danny
(
edward
furlong
)
,
mother
(
beverly
d
'
angelo
)
,
and
sister
,
davin
(
jennifer
lien
)
.
the
film
opens
with
a
flashback
,
in
which
derek
brutally
kills
two
black
men
vandalizing
his
car
.
we
find
out
that
this
lands
him
in
prison
,
and
the
film
from
that
point
is
seen
through
the
eyes
of
danny
.
in
the
present
-
time
of
the
film
,
danny
is
in
high
school
,
and
eager
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
his
brother
.
much
of
the
film
is
told
in
flashback
,
and
we
see
the
path
that
leads
to
derek
'
s
adoption
of
white
supremacy
.
when
derek
is
released
,
having
served
three
years
in
prison
,
he
finds
that
his
brother
is
now
a
full
-
blown
skinhead
;
derek
,
however
,
has
given
up
the
violence
,
and
tries
to
get
his
brother
to
understand
why
racism
and
the
violence
that
comes
with
it
are
bad
things
.
what
makes
this
all
interesting
is
that
these
two
young
men
are
not
stupid
,
thoughtless
people
--
they
are
intelligent
and
articulate
,
and
voice
their
beliefs
in
disturbingly
straightforward
terms
.
it
'
s
hard
to
make
a
controversial
movie
and
not
preach
,
but
kaye
has
found
the
right
note
for
his
material
.
because
american
history
x
is
a
mainstream
film
,
there
has
to
be
a
redemption
phase
for
our
main
character
--
some
people
may
think
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
make
him
sympathetic
.
i
partially
disagree
with
this
,
because
,
although
i
do
not
advocate
racism
in
any
way
,
it
'
s
interesting
the
way
kaye
presents
derek
--
he
is
a
loud
,
obnoxious
man
,
but
he
'
s
also
very
smart
.
the
reasons
for
why
he
becomes
a
skinhead
are
believable
--
his
father
was
arbitrarily
killed
by
a
group
of
black
men
.
it
'
s
clear
that
he
'
s
passionate
about
his
beliefs
,
and
that
he
'
s
not
just
a
punk
looking
for
an
excuse
to
beat
people
up
.
of
course
,
it
helps
that
kaye
has
an
actor
as
talented
as
norton
to
play
this
part
.
it
'
s
astonishing
how
frightening
norton
looks
with
a
shaved
head
and
a
swastika
on
his
chest
.
in
addition
to
getting
the
look
just
right
,
he
'
s
perfect
for
this
role
--
derek
requires
intelligence
,
depth
,
and
a
whole
lot
of
shouting
,
and
norton
does
it
all
with
ease
.
even
when
he
'
s
at
his
meanest
,
derek
has
a
likable
quality
to
him
,
and
that
'
s
a
gutsy
approach
when
telling
a
story
about
a
skinhead
.
what
adds
depth
to
the
story
is
a
subplot
in
which
the
principal
of
danny
'
s
school
(
avery
brooks
)
becomes
obsessed
with
purging
the
hatred
from
danny
.
the
other
performances
are
all
terrific
,
with
standouts
from
furlong
,
d
'
angelo
,
and
lien
.
visually
,
the
film
is
very
powerful
.
kaye
indulges
in
a
lot
of
interesting
artistic
choices
,
and
most
of
them
work
nicely
--
lots
of
slow
-
motion
and
strange
camera
angles
add
to
a
moody
atmosphere
.
but
,
like
a
lot
of
movies
lately
,
american
history
x
skims
past
greatness
in
the
last
few
minutes
.
although
the
climactic
scene
is
very
moving
,
the
picture
ends
with
a
pretentious
,
preachy
resolution
featuring
a
brief
narration
from
a
character
who
was
killed
.
for
a
movie
so
smart
a
subtle
up
until
that
point
,
it
felt
like
a
slap
in
the
face
to
be
hand
-
fed
a
theme
in
such
a
simplistic
way
.
it
makes
me
wonder
what
,
exactly
,
tony
kaye
disliked
about
the
final
version
of
his
film
.
perhaps
this
last
scene
was
the
problem
.
it
'
s
hard
to
imagine
any
director
not
being
at
least
partially
pleased
with
a
film
this
good
--
in
a
time
when
so
many
movies
are
timid
and
weak
,
american
history
x
manages
to
make
a
compelling
argument
for
racism
without
advocating
it
any
way
.
one
of
my
colleagues
was
surprised
when
i
told
her
i
was
willing
to
see
betsy
'
s
wedding
.
and
she
was
shocked
to
hear
that
i
actually
liked
it
.
her
reaction
was
understandable
when
you
consider
that
the
film
revolves
around
molly
ringwald
,
who
hasn
'
t
made
a
worthwhile
film
since
1986
.
but
the
fact
is
,
betsy
'
s
wedding
is
also
an
alan
alda
film
.
and
while
ringwald
has
been
making
duds
for
the
last
four
years
,
alda
has
been
involved
with
several
noteworthy
projects
,
including
crimes
and
misdemeanors
and
a
new
life
.
written
and
directed
by
alda
,
betsy
'
s
wedding
is
a
vibrant
slice
-
of
-
life
,
mixing
a
few
dramatic
moments
into
a
big
bowl
of
whimsical
humor
.
alda
'
s
comic
elixir
is
smooth
and
refreshing
--
and
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
summer
fare
.
as
bride
and
groom
,
molly
ringwald
and
dylan
walsh
are
the
pivotal
characters
in
the
film
,
but
they
are
by
far
the
least
interesting
.
walsh
is
a
nonentity
,
with
all
the
screen
presence
of
a
door
knob
.
ringwald
is
simply
unbearable
and
is
easily
the
weakest
link
in
the
chain
.
she
looks
hideous
with
her
short
-
cropped
orange
hair
,
red
lip
-
stick
and
grotesque
outfits
.
she
'
s
supposed
to
be
a
dress
designer
,
but
she
looks
more
like
a
clown
.
and
to
make
matters
worse
,
ringwald
'
s
performance
matches
her
appearance
.
thankfully
,
alda
keeps
ringwald
'
s
screen
time
to
a
minimum
;
he
is
far
more
interested
in
the
colorful
periphery
characters
.
the
wedding
is
just
a
device
to
bring
together
the
bride
'
s
working
-
class
,
italian
family
and
the
groom
'
s
rich
,
gentile
family
.
ringwald
'
s
folks
are
homey
and
down
-
to
-
earth
,
with
alda
as
her
free
-
spirited
father
,
madeline
kahn
as
her
practical
mother
,
and
ally
sheedy
as
her
lonely
sister
.
walsh
'
s
clan
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
prim
,
proper
and
ostentatious
.
when
the
two
families
meet
and
mingle
,
the
movie
becomes
a
story
of
culture
clash
,
or
as
one
character
puts
it
,
"
money
versus
values
.
"
ally
sheedy
,
in
a
wonderfully
understated
performance
,
is
one
of
the
film
'
s
most
pleasant
surprises
.
sheedy
expresses
more
with
just
her
eyes
than
ringwald
does
with
her
entire
body
.
it
'
s
anthony
lapaglia
,
however
,
who
seizes
the
spotlight
.
lapaglia
plays
stevie
dee
,
a
suave
,
overly
polite
mafioso
who
is
formally
courting
sheedy
with
old
-
fashioned
chivalry
.
lapaglia
'
s
sincere
but
dim
-
witted
character
is
a
riot
.
and
what
'
s
uncanny
is
that
lapaglia
is
a
dead
ringer
for
robert
de
niro
,
with
a
little
bit
of
alec
baldwin
thrown
in
for
good
measure
.
lapaglia
seems
to
have
attended
the
de
niro
school
of
gangster
acting
,
and
his
inspired
performance
is
partly
a
tribute
to
his
role
-
model
and
partly
a
rip
-
off
.
i
don
'
t
know
whether
to
say
a
star
is
born
or
a
star
is
re
-
born
,
but
i
do
know
that
lapaglia
'
s
over
-
the
-
top
performance
should
not
be
missed
.
the
scrumptious
comic
acting
,
however
,
extends
well
beyond
sheedy
and
lapaglia
.
joe
pesci
,
in
particular
,
sinks
his
teeth
into
his
role
as
alda
'
s
unscrupulous
brother
-
in
-
law
,
a
slum
lord
with
mob
ties
,
who
is
cheating
on
his
wife
(
catherine
o
'
hara
)
.
alda
,
faced
with
challenge
of
both
directing
and
acting
,
somehow
finds
just
the
right
comic
touch
as
the
bride
'
s
financially
-
strapped
father
,
a
carpenter
whose
dreams
are
bigger
than
his
wallet
.
the
film
adopts
alda
'
s
psychological
point
of
view
as
he
tries
to
one
:
plan
the
wedding
,
and
two
:
pay
for
it
.
as
a
filmmaker
,
alda
'
s
style
of
humor
is
remarkably
restrained
and
tasteful
.
and
while
he
doesn
'
t
have
the
comic
genius
of
a
woody
allen
,
alda
does
possess
the
inspiration
to
make
movies
which
are
ten
times
more
entertaining
than
the
slop
which
usually
passes
for
comedy
.
after
bloody
clashes
and
independence
won
,
lumumba
refused
to
pander
to
the
belgians
,
who
continued
a
condescending
and
paternalistic
relationship
with
the
congo
.
their
officers
,
particularly
general
janssens
(
rudi
delhem
)
in
the
force
publique
,
the
congo
'
s
army
,
caused
rebellions
,
undermining
lumumba
,
who
was
outraged
at
the
rape
and
murder
of
belgian
nationals
.
with
unrest
building
,
moise
tshombe
(
pascal
nzonzi
)
and
the
province
of
katanga
,
which
contained
70
percent
of
the
country
'
s
resources
,
proclaimed
secession
.
lumumba
replaced
janssens
,
making
mobutu
a
colonel
,
and
went
on
a
pacification
tour
with
congolese
president
joseph
kasa
vubu
(
maka
kotto
)
,
but
it
was
too
late
.
'
when
you
want
to
drown
a
dog
,
you
say
it
has
rabies
,
'
prophesies
lumumba
of
his
own
fate
.
peck
and
bonitzer
do
an
exemplary
job
telling
a
complicated
tale
with
a
myriad
of
players
,
although
they
frequently
succumb
to
cliche
,
particularly
regarding
lumumba
'
s
private
life
.
peck
'
s
script
illuminates
bantu
sayings
like
'
the
hand
that
gives
,
rules
'
when
lumumba
uses
it
with
the
american
ambassador
.
peck
'
s
direction
is
less
assured
,
with
many
scenes
unfortunately
playing
like
standard
television
fare
.
he
'
s
served
well
,
though
,
by
his
casting
of
ebouaney
in
the
title
role
.
ebouaney
is
dynamic
,
radiating
his
character
'
s
fierce
passion
for
his
people
and
his
country
.
lumumba
'
s
intelligence
and
ability
to
strategize
,
even
as
he
'
s
cornered
by
insurmountable
odds
,
are
given
life
by
ebouaney
.
peck
'
s
subject
and
lead
actor
elevate
his
film
above
its
mediocre
production
.
"
lumumba
"
is
a
story
that
deserves
to
be
told
and
ebouaney
'
s
performance
makes
the
tragedy
personally
felt
.
the
american
action
film
has
been
slowly
drowning
to
death
in
a
sea
of
asian
wire
-
fu
copycats
.
it
'
s
not
a
pretty
death
,
and
it
'
s
leaving
the
likes
of
schwartznager
,
stallone
,
and
van
damme
wearing
cement
galoshes
at
the
bottom
of
a

.
sometimes
,
the
mix
results
in
a
mind
-
blowing
spectacle
unlike
any
other

quality
action
with
amazing
and
exciting
stunt
work
,
as
in
1999
'
s
the
matrix
,
can
be
a
real
gem
.
but
too
often
hollywood
gets
it
wrong
,
even
when
they
pay
off
chinese
directors
.
flying
ninjas
and
floating
karate
masters
have
been
replaced
by
soaring
bronx
detectives
and
slow

.
mostly
it
'
s
laughable
.
in
hollywood
'
s
rush
to
emulate
the
success
of
the
matrix
,
trademark
asian
stunt
choreography
has
become
more
of
a
joke
than
an
art
form
.
but
iron
monkey
,
the
latest
asian
import
,
shows
us
how
to
get
it
right
.
iron
monkey
(
actually
a
reissue
of
a
1993
film
)
is
the
story
of
a
19th
chinese
vigilante
(
rongguang
yu
)
,
fighting
with
his
own
unique
style
of
shaolin
kung
fu
for
the
rights
of
the
oppressed
and
the
bellies
of
the
hungry
.
but
it
is
also
a
piece
of
the
narrative
of
legendary
chinese
film
hero
wong
fei
-
hong
,
most
recently
seen
in
one
of
the
most
overlooked
,
and
possibly
best
films
of
2000
,
drunken
master
2
(
released
in
the
u
.
s
.
as
the
legend
of
drunken
master
)
.
unlike
drunken
master
2
,
which
stars
jackie

as
an
adult
fei

,
iron
monkey
finds
a
much
younger
fei

hong
(

)
and
his
father
wong
kei
-
ying
(
yen

)
thrust
into
the
middle
of
iron
monkey
'
s
fight
against
oppression
.
iron
monkey
succeeds
as
no
kung
fu
film
since
drunken
master
2
.
at
times
,
fighting
styles
,
especially
that
of
monkey
himself
,

devolve
into
the
ridiculous
twinkle

toed
floating
of
films
like
crouching
tiger
,
hidden
dragon
,
director
yuen
wo
ping
eventually
remembers
to
bring
his
action
scenes
back
to
earth
.
iron
monkey
is
at
its
heart
a
hardcore
,
kung
fu
action
film
rather
than
any
kind
of
drama
a
la
crouching
tiger
.
however
,
there
are
brief
moments
of
profoundness
shared
between
characters
,
such
as
those
that
pass
between
our
outlaw
hero
and
his
good
-
hearted
but
misguided
enemy
,
chief
fox
.
in
those
moments
,
and
in
others
,
iron
monkey
manages
to
transcend
its
mindless
kung
fu
nature
to
touch
the
hearts
and
minds
of
its
audience
.
while
in
no
way
the
equal
of
a
masterpiece
like
drunken
master
2
,
iron
monkey
dances
quite
nicely
to
the
invading
kung
fu
tune

after

last

that

when

i

gags
and

out
silliness
.
hands
down
,
this
is
the
most
fun
film
of
the
summer
.
the
movie
begins
with
zippy
retro
-
style
opening
credits
that
look
like
they
were
torn
straight
out
of
a
'
60s
slapstick
comedy
,
featuring
animated
photos
of
the
cast
attached
to
herky
-
jerky
bodies
bounding
around
the
screen
.
then
comes
the
setup
.
donald

extremely
rich
owner
of

i

not

city

that
bad
.
it
had
a
lot
going
for
it

but
somewhere
along
the
way
,
it
faltered
.
somehow
,
underneath
the
seemingly
poetic
beauty
of
it

,
there
was
a
gigantic
hole

covered
with
iridescent
performances

glossy
cinematography

the
predictable
ending
that
shattered
our
hopes
(
even
though
we

it

)
only
added
to
the
disappointment
.
but
for
over
an
hour
,
city
of

is
well
worth
the
time
.
nicolas
cage
is
seth
,
a
guardian
angel
who
,
like
hundreds
(
likely
thousands
or
even
millions
)
of
other
angels
,
spends
eternity
watching
over

citizens

how
much
celestial

meg
ryan
,
in
her
most
subdued
performance

,
plays
maggie

doctor
who
begins
to
ponder
exactly
who
it
is
we
'
re
fighting
against
when
we
fight
to
keep
someone
alive
.
after
losing
a
patient
on
the
surgery
table
,
these
questions
envelope
maggie
,
and
seth
,
the
angel
who
was
there
to
oversee
the
patient
'
s
transition
into
the
afterlife
,
is
immediately
captivated
by
the
doctor
.
he
begins
following
and
observing
maggie
,
falling
more
and
more
in
love
with
her
everyday
.
angels
,
who
we
quickly
learn
are
not
and
never
were
humans
,
can
not
experience
human
sensations
such
as
taste
and
touch
,
but
they
do
have
the
ability
to
make
themselves
seen
to
anyone
they
desire
.
seth
'
s
adoration
is
too
much
to
resist
,
and
eventually
he
does
appear
to
maggie
,
quite
regularly
,
although
such
a
thing
seems
taboo
among
the
angelic
community
.
the
angels
are
interestingly
presented
,
all
of
them
dressed
in
black
and
more
reminiscent
of
hitmen
than
traditional
glowing
white
entities
,
but
it
'
s
a
nice
touch
that
never
seems
like
a
mere
attempt
at
uniqueness
.

wonderfully
versatile
actor
(

and
it
could
happen
to
you

what
a
combo

)
who
slips
into
the
role
of
a
heavenly
agent
quite
nicely
but
threatens
sappiness
more
than
once
.
it
'
s
nice
to
see
ryan
pick
up
roles
like
this
and
the
one
in
courage
under
fire
.
the
two
aren
'
t
very
comparable
to
each
other
,
but
they
both
deviate
from
her
usual
"
intelligently
ditzy
"
romantic
comedy
roles
,
and
it
'
s
an
impressive
side
of
ryan
movie
goers
rarely
have
the
chance
to
enjoy
.
but
even
though
the
two
leads
do
an
impressive
job
,
it
is
dennis
franz
who
grabs
us
with
his
interpretation
of
a
hospital
patient
who
knows
more
than
meets
the
eye
.
it
'
s
a
shame
that
with
so
much
going
for
it
,
city
of
angels
falters
so
much
in
its
final
stages
,
leaving
us
with
the
realization
that
an
emotionally
incredible
movie
was
out
there
,
they
just
didn
'
t
know
quite
how
to
get
to
it
.
they
struggle
for
an
impacting
conclusion
and
wind
up
with
painful
thud
rather
than
an
exhilarating
high
.
filmmakers
should
know
your
final
impression
will
be
the
one
you
linger
on
,
remember
,
and
convey
to
others
thru
word

,
so
after
telling
us
for
60
+
minutes
that
this
film
is
a
glorious
masterpiece
,
they
sure
leave
us
with
a
disheartening
taste
of

in
our
mouths

based
on

review
:
a
small
but
enchanting
movie
,
"
hearts
in
atlantis
"
easily
recalls
another
king
-
inspired
coming
-
of
-
age
film
,
"
stand
by
me
"
,
both
in
terms
of
its
setting
and
the
sentiment
it
conveys
.
"
hearts
"
is
a
tribute
to
the
magic
of
childhood
,
to
those
summers
when
the
days
seem
neverending
,
and
nothing
means
more
than
your
closest
friends
.
unlike
"
stand
by
me
"
,
there
is
a
supernatural
element
to
"
hearts
"
,
but
although
it
is
key
to
the
plot
,
it
is
not
prominent
.
like
"
stand
by
me
"
,
this
is
a
mostly
character
-
driven
film
,
and
as
such
it
benefits
greatly
from
superb
casting
.
yelchin
is
very
good
as
bobby
,
finding
a
good
mix
of
innocence
and
resignation
.
more
splendid
still
is
boorem
,
whom
i
praised
highly
for
her
work
in
"
along
came
a
spider
"
and
who
is
simply
radiant
here
as
carol
.
and
then
there
is
hopkins
,
who
despite
playing
such
a
quiet
,
introspective
character
as
ted
,
nonetheless
commands
our
attention
every
time
he
is
onscreen
.
less
successful
is
davis
,
whose
strident
elizabeth
comes
across
as
overly
cartoonish
.
i
also
found
it
odd
that
bobby
and
carol
'
s
other
friend
,
sully
(
whose
death
as
an
adult
sets
up
the
movie
'
s
flashback
framing
device
)
,
is
paid
virtually
no
attention
.
but
hicks
'
direction
is
lovely
without
being
cloying
,
and
despite
the
movie
'
s
general
lack
of
incident
,
it
never
ceases
to
weave
its
spell
over
the
audience
.

,
since

was
outlawed
at

people

couldn

unenviable

of
going

are
often
at

is
usually
armed
and
most
likely
mentally
unstable
,
prone
to
turn
on
the
negotiator
at
a
moment

the
negotiator
must
therefore
be
something
of
an
actor
,
psychologist
,
and
sham
artist
,
in
addition
to
being
a
police
officer
;
he
must
be
able
to
think
on
his
feet
and
either
work
toward
the
goal
of
ending
the
confrontation
without
violence
,
or
failing
that
,
must
be
prepared
to
facilitate
the
conclusion
of
the
crisis
through
firepower
.
most
of
all
,
the
negotiator
must
be
able
to
enter
a
situation
with
as
little
intelligence
about
the
scenario
as
possible
,
and
quickly
gain
control
of
the
situation
,
dominate
the
conversation
,
and
influence
the
perpetrator
into
thinking
that
the
end
of
the
conflict
is
what
he
really
wants
.
it
takes
a
pretty
smart
person
to
do
that
.
but
what
if
the
hostage

holding

is
just
as
smart
?
what
if
he

office

i
don
'
t
quite
remember
if
the
captain
actually
said
,
"
i
hate
to
do
this
,
but
.
.
.
"
,
although
it
wouldn
'
t
surprise
me
if
he
did
.
luckily
,
the
film
soon
shakes
off
the
conventionalism
and
concentrates
on
the
interesting
premise
mentioned
above
.
after
being
offered
a
take
-
it
-
or
-
leave
-
it
deal
by
the
district
attorney
,
roman
resolves
to
prove
his
innocence
by
walking
into
the
office
of
internal
affairs
inspector
niebaum
(
j
.
t
.
walsh
)
,
taking
him
and
others
hostage
,
and
proclaiming
he
has
been
framed
.
although
roman
'
s
actions
seem
forced
due
to
the
compressed
nature
of
his
motivational
build
-
up
,
gray
redeems
himself
by
involving
us
with
the
negotiations
between
roman
and
fellow
police
negotiator
chris
sabian
(
kevin
spacey
)
which
soon
ensue
.
jackson
,
while
a
superb
actor
,
is
miscast
in
the
role
of
roman
.
the
actor
has
become
so
popular
,
and
so
often
identified
as
a
protagonist
(
notable
exceptions
can
be
found
,
such
as
in
jackie
brown
)
,
that
we
as
an
audience
have
a
difficult
time
believing
he
will
carry
out
his
threats
.
the
script
also
clearly
sets
him
up
as
the
good
guy
who
is
only
trying
to
prove
his
innocence
.
how
can
we
believe
he
'
s
going
to
shoot
a
hostage
,
no
matter
if
the
hostage
tried
to
kill
him
earlier
?
unfortunately
,
this
preconception
saps
the
film
of
some
of
it
'
s
would
-
be
suspenseful
moments
,
and
anything
good
left
in
those
scenes
is
largely
attributed
to
jackson
'
s
acting
ability
.
almost
every
time
he
'
s
in
a
scene
,
jackson
steals
it
without
looking
back
.
when
spacey
appears
,
the
film
has
already
run
about
a
third
of
its
course
.
his
is
an
interesting
character
.
made
out
to
be
some
kind
of
negotiating
superman
,
our
first
look
at
him
has
him
hopelessly
trying
to
get
his
family
moving
to
set
out
on
vacation
.
"
i
can
talk
a
man
out
of
blowing
up
the
sears
tower
,
but
i
can
'
t
talk
my
wife
out
of
the
bedroom
or
my
daughter
off
the
phone
,
"
he
says
.
when
he
gets
the
call
to
action
,
however
,
he
quickly
changes
gears
and
becomes
the
man
we
expect
him
to
be
.
soon
,
his
character
has
to
negotiate
not
only
with
roman
,
but
also
with
the
swat
commander
(
david
morse
)
who
is
itching
to
send
in
a
team
to
take
roman
out
,
all
the
while
keeping
wary
of
the
fbi
agents
who
are
waiting
to
take
over
the
operation
,
should
negotiations
fail
.
this
complex
set
of
pressures
are
reflected
well
in
sabian
the
negotiator
and
spacey
the
actor
.
as
the
second
protagonist
,
spacey
measures
up
nicely
.
gray
really
lucked
out
with
this
cast
.
david
morse
as
commander
beck
,
ron
rifkin
as
commander
frost
,
and
john
spencer
as
police
chief
al
travis
are
all
more
than
competent
,
and
can
hold
their
own
in
scenes
with
jackson
and
spacey
.
the
only
problem
is
the
bit
of
typecasting
that
results
from
these
choices
:
morse
played
a
similar
role
in
the
rock
,
rifkin
played
the
d
.
a
.
in
l
.
a
.
confidential
,
and
spencer
played
a
police
detective
in
cop
land
.
with
the
level
of
acting
,
however
,
this
can
be
forgiven
.
also
in
the
supporting
cast
,
paul
giamatti
as
rudy
,
one
of
the
hostages
,
is
notable
for
the
comic
relief
he
provides
.
his
character
is
initially
so
slimy
,
and
giamatti
himself
just
looks
so
shifty
,
that
you
expect
to
laugh
before
he
even
says
anything
.
fortunately
,
this
doesn
'
t
distract
from
the
seriousness
of
the
rest
of
the
film
,
but
instead
provides
some
nice
breathers
from
the
level
of
tension
which
gray
manages
to
sustain
throughout
.

walsh
,
as
the
suspicious
internal
affairs
inspector
,
clocks
in
with
one
of
his
final
performances
.
sadly
,
the
talented
but
underrated
actor
passed
away
in
late
february
of
this
year
,
and
the
soon
to
be
released
pleasantville
will
mark
his
last
film
.
walsh
appeared
in
dozens
of
movies
such
as
good
morning
vietnam
,
backdraft
,
and
nixon
.
for
one
of
his
best
performances
,
check
out
sling
blade
,
in
which
he
plays
a
mental
patient
sharing
a
ward
with
billy
bob
thornton
.
when
jack
nicholson
accepted
his
best
actor
oscar
in
march
,
walsh
was
one
of
the
men
to
whom
he
credited
his
success
(
the
actors
performed
together
in
a
few
good
men
)
.
the
negotiator
is
actually
dedicated
to
walsh
,
and
while
inspector
niebaum
may
not
have
been
his
best
role
,
it
certainly
characterizes
the
type
of
character
for
which
walsh
had
become
most
famous
for
playing
.
in
the
end
,
the
negotiator
has
a
plotline
that
parallels
it
'
s
reality
.
we
'
re
served
with
the
premise
that
two
equally
deft
negotiators
are
battling
each
other
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
manner
which
will
suit
each
of
them
best
.
as
an
audience
,
we
'
re
also
given
a
situation
where
two
wonderfully
talented
actors
are
thrown
into
a
movie
,
and
we
'
d
like
to
see
if
one
will
dominate
the
film

both
provide
some
pretty
good
entertainment

plot
:
a
young
man
who
loves
heavy
metal
music
and
especially
the
band
steel
dragon
,
to
whom
he
'
s
devoted
a

,
gets
launched

stardom
when

call
on
him
to
take

place

critique
:
i
'
m
a
sucker
for
movies
like
this
.
a
young
man
with
a
humble
background
and
lofty
dreams
,
works
hard
,
devotes
the
time
,
the
energy
and
the
patience
,
and
ultimately
hits
it
big
-
time
.
in
the
case
of
this
film
,
our
boy
loves
a
certain
heavy
metal
band
and
as
luck
would
have
it
(
yup
,
luck
always
finds
its
way
into
these
types
of
equations
,
although
generally
tied
very
closely
to
hard
work
)
,
they
need
a
new
singer
.
his
entry
and
adaptation
to
the
whole
"
rock
'
n
roll
"
lifestyle
fills
the
rest
of
the
film
and
is
really
fun
to
watch
.
although
i
will
preface
this
by
saying
that
one
thing
that
would
definitely
enhance
your
appreciation
for
this
film
is
your
own
love
(
or
past
love
)
of
heavy
metal
music
and
the
whole
scene
around
it
.
metal
was
one
of
my
first
loves
as
a
teen
and
even
though
the
genre
of
music
isn
'
t
that
prominent
anymore
,
i
still
check
out
my
motley
crue
,
twisted
sister
and
anthrax
cds
every
now
and
again
.
that
'
s
not
to
say
that
you
won
'
t
like
this
film
if
you
don
'
t
like
the
music
,
but
the
music
and
live
performances
from
the
band
,
play
a
big
part
in
the
movie
,
and
i
for
one
,
had
a
blast
watching
and
listening
to
it
all
.
but
the
even
greater
draw
in
this
film
is
the
standout
performance
given
here
by
mark
wahlberg
.
wow
,
hand
this
fella
some
major
props
,
as
he
totally
becomes
this
heavy
metal
geek
/
god
(
incidentally
,
metal
god
was
the
film
'
s
original
title
,
and
a
much
better
one
if
you
ask
me
)
.
he
is
this
movie
and
i
was
quite
taken
by
his
character
pretty
much
the
whole
way
through
.
he
came
off
like
a
regular
guy
with
extremely
passionate
goals
and
work
ethic
,
who
was
willing
to
do
anything
in
order
to
fulfill
his
dreams
.
aniston
was
also
surprisingly
good
as
the
girlfriend
(
and
the
romance
angle
between
them
was
sweet
)
,
but
she
didn
'
t
pull
me
in
hard
enough
during
their
emotional
scenes
.
i
was
also
impressed
by
some
of
the
"
real
"
musicians
who
played
in
the
film
(
zakk
wylde
from
ozzy
osbourne
,
jeff
pilson
from
dokken
,
stephan
jenkins
from
third
eye
blind
,
blas
elias
from
slaughter
)
,
but
actor
dominic
west
as
kirk
cuddy
made
the
biggest
impression
among
the
band
members
.
it
'
s
to
note
that
this
film
was
based
on
a
real
-
life
tale
of
a
young
man
who
used
to
sing
in
a
judas
priest
cover
band
and
then
went
on
to
become
their
actual
singer
(
their
original
singer
also
admitted
to
being
gay
,
as
in
this
film
)
.
just
for
the
record
,
i
'
m
certainly
not
recommending
this
film
for
its
originality
or
surprise
elements
,
since
most
of
this
stuff
has
already
been
covered
in
some
way
or
another
in
other
movies
,
but
because
it
'
s
a
fun
,
uplifting
,
well
-
paced
movie
with
a
solid
central
showing
by
wahlberg
and
energetic
live
performances
.
oh
yeah
,
and
for
those
who
dig
the
"
heavier
"
side
of
music
,
the
soundtrack

role

and
charles

psychiatrist

the
jokes
come
in
fast
and
so
do
the
laughs

with
humorous
antics
between
the
matron
and
sir
bernard
.
this
time
,
williams
is
after
matron
(

when
he
needs
to
prove
himself
that
he
is
a
man
after
visiting
dr

goode

the
doctor
(

is

to

:

is

with

robbery
of

hospital
'
s
pills
with
panic
ensuing
.
there
are
good
performances
by
hattie
jacques

the
matron
,
however
her
character
seems
a
little
more
subdued
and
quieter
than
her
previous
'
matron
'
s
'
.
williams
is
,
as
usual
,
on
top
form
,
but
sid
james
isn

t
given
a
very
good
part
in
this
movie
and
i
would
forgive
anyone
to
forget
that
he
was
in
the
movie
at
all
.
the
same
does
not
go
for
charles
hawtrey
,
for
although
he
only
first
appears
in
the
movie
after
30
minutes
gone
and
has
scarce
screen
time
,
he
seems
to
steal
every
scene
he
is
in
.
by
not
making
use
of
sid
james
and
barbara
windsor
'
s
talent
to
full
effect
,
the
film
seems
to
flounder
,
but
it
certainly
makes
up
for
it
with
it
'
s
good
storyline
and
it
'
s
other
appealing
characters

this
film
is
genuinely
funny

i
could
watch
it
again
and
again
and
not
get
bored

the
ultimate
match
up
between
good
and
evil
,
"
the
untouchables
"
is
an
excellent
movie
because
it
looks
deeper
into
an
already
examined
rivalry
.
based
on
the
1959
television
show
of
the
same
title
,
"
the
untouchables
"
may
be
an
exaggeration
of
the
real
life
events
that
took
place
,
but
it
fits
together
perfectly
with
some
beautifully
filmed
action
sequences
,
some
excellent
acting
,
a
memorable
score
,
and
a
clever
script
.
the
film
takes
place
in
chicago
during
the
prohibition
era
where
mobsters
led
by
the
ruthless
al
capone
run
an
underground
market
of
liquor
to
the
demanding
public
.
elliot
ness
and
a
small
force
of
men
known
as
the
untouchables
attempt
the
impossible
by
trying
to
stop
capone
and
trying
to
maintain
peace
and
order
.
however
,
as
ness
soon
learns
,
in
order
to
stabilize
peace
,
you
have
to
bend
a
few
laws
.
the
fact
that
capone
is
evil
is
very
apparent
from
the
first
few
scenes
.
the
film
begins
with
capone
,
played
perfectly
by
deniro
,
declaring
that
he
is
not
a
violent
man
and
he
is
a
firm
believer
in
following
all
laws
.
the
film
then
quickly
transfers
to
the
next
scene
in
which
one
of
capone
'
s
men
bombs
a
restaurant
that
contains
many
innocent
people
including
a
little
girl
.
from
this
point
we
know
capone
is
evil
,
not
only
because
he
kills
without
hesitation
,
but
also
because
he
is
a
lying
bastard
.
right
from
the
first
five
minutes
of
the
film
,
de
palma
has
created
a
hatred
towards
capone
and
he
shows
that
this
man
must
be
brought
down
at
all
costs
.
this
developed
hatred
is
before
the
film
'
s
hero
,
ness
,
is
even
introduced
.
i
found
this
approach
to
be
very
clever
because
in
a
small
duration
of
time
there
is
a
great
amount
of
admiration
for
ness
and
an
equal
amount
of
hatred
for
capone
.
the
film
only
gets
better
from
this
point
.
with
the
formation
of
the
untouchables
,
there
is
a
group
of
men
wearing
long
,
dark
overcoats
and
hats
.
they
walk
in
unison
and
they
only
look
forward
.
as
they
walk
down
the
streets
they
are
observed
and
feared
by
citizens
.
holding
shot
guns
and
pistols
in
their
hands
to
stop
criminals
,
this
image
of
vigilantes
must
have
influenced
future
films
.
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
"
the
matrix
"
when
neo
,
morpheus
,
trinity
,
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
first
come
into
the
virtual
world
.
wearing
more
futuristic
outfits
of
the
same
1930
'
s
style
,
the
similarities
between
these
two
are
countless
.
"
the
untouchables
"
has
some
of
the
hippest
,
bravest
heroes
in
any
action
film
.
the
four
members
were
the
only
ones
willing
to
go
against
capone
'
s
army
.
each
member
of
this
special
group
also
had
their
own
characteristics
that
separated

.
elliot
ness
,
played
with
perfect
ingenuity
by
kevin
costner
,
is
a
character
that
surely
grows
during
the
course
of
the
film
.
he
begins
as
a
man
who
is
determined
to
follow
all
laws
no
matter
how
unfair
they
may
be
.
however
,
as
the
film
develops
so
does
ness
.
his
beliefs
involving
the
law
are
shattered
when
he
realizes
that
those
he
trusted
are
actually
members
of
the
other
side
.
he
also
begins
to
lose
his
stability
when
his
adversaries
begin
to
murder
his
friends
.
his
anger
becomes
so
thunderous
that
he
can
no
longer
hold
it
in
.
sean
connery
,
who
won
an
academy
award
for
best
supporting
actor
in
his
role
,
plays
malone
,
an
aging
cop
who
decides
to
make
one
final
run
as
a
member
of
the
untouchables
.
malone
acts
as
a
mentor
to
ness
.
he
teaches
him
"
the
chicago
way
"
to
do
things
;
when
they
attack
with
a
knife
,
you
attack
with
a
gun
.
connery
plays
his
character
with
the
exact
amount
of
wit
and
experience
needed
.
andy
garcia
does
a
wonderful
job
as
george
stone
,
a
young
man
who
is
just
becoming
a
police
officer
.
as
ness
grows
,
he
begins
to
teach
stone
some
valuable
lessons
that
malone
once
taught
him
.
charles
martin
smith
is
also
fantastic
as
the
final
member
who
attempts
to
use
an
income
tax
offense
against
capone
.
smith
is
perfect
for
his
role
as
he
adds
some
valuable
comic
relief
to
the
film
.
the
action
scenes
are
also
some
of
the
most
beautifully
choreographed
i
have
ever
seen
.
also
very
similar
to
"
the
matrix
,
"
they
are
exciting
and
intense
.
>
from
a
western
-
like
battle
to
the
famous
confrontation
at
the
train
station
steps
,
the
scenes
are
well
thought
out
and
well
executed
.
the
score
during
these
scenes
ingeniously
adds
to
the
excitement
.
its
pounding
drum
beats
act
as
a
rhythm
for
the
actors
.
the
combination
of
image
and
music
is
very
impressive
and
also
very
effective
.
although
the
real
life
untouchables
may
have
been
excessively
glorified
,
this
film
is
pure
entertainment
and
contains
a
unique
blend
of
great
acting
,
great
directing
,
and
great
action
.
some
scenes
(
capone
and
the
baseball
bat
,
the
train
station
)
have
stuck
in
my
mind
for
years
and
seeing
them
again
will
only
make
them
more
vivid
.
having
not
seen
,
"
who
framed
roger
rabbit
"
in
over
10
years
,
and
not
remembering
much
besides
that
i
liked
it
then
,
i
decided
to
rent
it
recently
.
watching
it
i
was
struck
by
just
how
brilliant
a
film
it
is
.
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
'
s
a
milestone
in
animation
in
movies
(
it
'
s
the
first
film
to
combine
real
actors
and
cartoon
characters
,
have
them
interact
,
and
make
it
convincingly
real
)
and
a
great
entertainment
it
'
s
also
quite
an
effective
comedy
/
mystery
.
while
the
plot
may
be
somewhat
familiar
the
characters
are
original
,
especially
baby
herman
,
and
watching
them
together
is
a
lot
of
fun
.
the
story
begins
in
hollywood
in
1947
.
cartoon
star
roger

is
blowing
takes
and
having
trouble
keeping
his

on

maroon
(
alan

)
to
try
to
help
get
roger

back
on
work
.
maroon
thinks
that
roger
'
s
wife
,
jessica
'
s
,
possible
unfaithfulness
to
him
might
be
the
cause
of
distraction
and
tells
eddie
to
get
some
photos
of
her
in
the
act
before
it
costs
him
any
more
money
in
reshoots
.
valiant
takes
some
photos
of
jessica
playing
,
`
patty
cake
'
with
marvin
acme
(
stubby
kaye
)
,
the
owner
of
toontown
(
where
all
of
the
cartoon
characters
live
)
and
takes
them
to
maroon
.
upon
seeing
them
,
roger
is
emotionally
destroyed
and
soon
after
acme
is
found
dead
and
roger
rabbit
is
the
prime
suspect
.
the
rest
of
the
movie
follows
valiant
and
roger
as
they
run
around
town
(
and
eventually
toontown
)
trying
to
clear
roger

good
name

(
williams
and
his
teams
went
through
the
film
frame
by
frame
and
hand
drew
the
cartoon

in
)
.
director
robert
zemekis
must
be
given
an
equal
amount
of
praise
for
overseeing
the
entire
production
,
which
included
hundreds
of
animators
.
also
bob

performance
should
be
credited

he

in

according

"
there
'
s
something
about
ben
stiller
that
makes
him
a
popular
choice
among
casting
directors
these
days
.
stiller
currently
has
three
projects
in
circulation
,
and
what
other
actor
can
lay
claim
to
that
?
he
'
s
in

there
'

something
about
mary
,

which
i

and

acerbic

now
there

"
in
which
stiller
plays
another
jerry
,
this
one
a
heroin
-
addicted
television
writer
,
last
name
stahl
.
there
'
s
also
something
about
this
industry
that
pushes
bankable
stars
like
stiller
into
doing
drug

addiction
pictures
the
minute
they
'
ve
proved
themselves
commercially
.
ewan

springs
to

who
,
after
successful
turns
in

the
philosophy
appears
to
be

one
:
if
you
want
'
em
to
be
taken
seriously
,
make

.
"
permanent
midnight
"
is
based
on
the
true
life
experiences
of
jerry
stahl
,
a
successful
hollywood
writer
who
,
in
the
mid
-
eighties
,
had
a

own
words

the
size

"
as
stahl

stiller
contributes
a
commanding
performance

unlike
"

"
which
was
successful
in
having
it
both
ways
by
chronicling
both
the
highs
and
the
lows
of
heroin
abuse
,
"
permanent
midnight
"
instead
focuses
on
the
concept
of
drug
addiction
as
maintenance
.
one
of
the
earliest
observations
in
the
film
is
a
casual
reference
to
"
naked
lunch
"
author
william
s
.
burroughs
who
,
when
asked
why
he
shoots
up
first
thing
in
the
morning
responds
,
"
so
i
can

.
"
stahl
rarely
appears
to
be
puncturing
veins
for
the
thrill
of
it
all
in
"
permanent
midnight
"
;
it
'
s
so
he
can
talk
to
his
mother
on
the
phone
,
show
up
for
work
on
time
,
even
pay
his
bills
.
while
the
film
itself
occasionally
wobbles
around
along
with
stahl
,
the
writing
(
adapted
from
stahl
'
s
autobiography
by
director
david
veloz
)
is
controlled
and
pointed
.
"
permanent
midnight
"
shows
how
stahl
moved
from
new

to
l

a

to
--
again
in
the
author
'
s
words
--
"

(
yeah

)
;
why
he
entered
into
a
convenient
marriage
with

british
tv
exec
(
elizabeth
hurley
,
so
impossibly
polite
you
'
d
swear
her
single
profanity
was
dubbed
)
;
and
that
he
conceived
a
child
in
between
his
random
hirings
and
firings
.
stahl
narrates
all
this
in
a
motel
bedroom
to
a
sympathetic
lover
called
kitty
(

own
maria

)
with
whom
he

lots
of
mascara
around

eyes
,
has

,
to
his
credit
,
never

pushes
his
pill

popping

jabbing
performance
over
the
top
.
the
ubiquitous
stiller
is
the
reason
to
see
"
permanent
midnight
"
;
a
dark
,
comic
,
and
strangely
absorbing
study
of
assisted
living
.
by
phil
curtolo
mel
gibson
(
braveheart
)
gave
a
gripping
performance
as
the
father
of
a
young
kidnapped
boy
in
ron
howard
'
s
ransom
.
gibson
plays
tom
mullen
,
a
wealthy
business
tycoon
whose
past
actions
are
coming
back
to
haunt
him
as
a
deranged
psychopath
,
played
by
gary
sinise
(
forrest
gump
)
,
and
his
band
of
low
-
life
thugs
kidnap
his
only
son
for
$
2
million
.
tom
and
his
wife
,
kate
,
played
by
rene
russo
(
tin
cup
)
were
instructed
not
to
inform
the
police
,
but
they
contacted
the
fbi
.
minutes
later
,
an
elite
team
of
agents
led
by
delroy
lindo
(
broken
arrow
)
are
in
tom
'
s
house
and
wiring
every
phone
.
the
plot
sounds
average
,
just
like
most
other
kidnap
movies
that
you
'
ve
already
seen
,
and
it
was
nothing
more
than
that
.
that
is
until
about
half
-
way
through
the
movie
.
suddenly
,
tom
goes
to
the
fox
5
news
room
and
makes
a
live
broadcast
saying
,
"
this
is
your
ransom
.
but
this
is
as
close
as
you
will
ever
get
to
it
.
instead
,
i
am
offering
this
money
as
a
reward
on
your
head
,
dead
or
alive
.
"
at
this
point
,
the
plot
thickened
,
and
the
unusually
slow
start
of
the
film
turned
into
a
suspense
-
filled
action
film
with
great
stunts
.
the
last
half
of
the
film
is
very
well
done
.
another
thing
that
carries
this
film
are
the
superb
performances
by
gibson
and
sinise
,
as
they
collide
in
a
game
of
wits
over
their
cellular
phones
for
most
of
the
movie
.
owen
gleiberman
of
entertainment
weekly
commented
on
the
subject
:
"
it
makes
you
wonder
what
kidnappers
did
before
cell
phones
.
"
before
this
movie
,
sinise
played
mostly
"
good
guys
,
"
first
in
of
mice
&
men
,
then
in
forrest
gump
,
and
most
recently
,
in
apollo
13
.
but
he
was
surprisingly
devilish
and
cold
in
his
portrayal
of
a
cop
-
gone
-
bad
.
gibson
,
of
course
,
was
just
being
gibson
,
in
an
oscar
-
worthy
performance
.
although
most
of
the
scenes
were
quite
predictable
,
ransom
is
a
very
entertaining
and
suspenseful
film
.
,
one
can
not
observe
a
star
trek
movie
and
expect
to
see
serious
science
fiction
.
the
purpose
of
star
trek
is
to
provide
flashy
,
innocent
fun
.
sometimes
the
stories
are
compelling
.
sometimes
they
'
re
not
.
but
,
with
the
exception
of
the
first
film
in
the
series
(
which
provides
little
more
than
endless
shots
of
amazed
faces
)
,
i
'
ve
never
been
bored
by
any
of
the
enterprise
'
s
numerous
missions
.
star
trek
:
insurrection
is
no
exception
.
the
film
has
gotten
some
negative
reviews
(
a
friend
of
mine
actually
thinks
it
'
s
the
worst
in
the
series
)
,
but
i
'
m
not
really
sure
why
.
it
'
s
an
exciting
,
often
hilarious
movie
that
engaged
me
and
left
me
ready
for
the
next
star
trek
film
.
some
say
it
'
s
a
bit
too
light
,
and
more
of
a
long
episode
than
a
film
.
others
say
the
special
effects
are
cheesy
and
that
it
'
s
boring
.
i
simply
enjoyed
the
film
.
insurrection
,
which
is
the
second
film
to
feature
strictly
the
next
generation
cast
,
introduces
us
to
a
race
of
people
called
the
ba
'
ku
;
the
ba
'
ku
are
very
old
(
most
of
them
are
about
three
hundred
years
old
)
,
but
they
actually
appear
younger
with
age
due
to
strange
radiation
in
the
rings
of
their
planet
.
of
course
,
these
peaceful
people
can
'
t
horde
this
fountain
of
youth
all
for
themselves
?
leave
it
up
to
their
archenemies
,
the
son
'
a
,
led
by
ru
'
afo
(
f
.
murray
abraham
)
,
to
mess
everything
up
.
the
son
'
a
,
who
are
horribly
disfigured
and
rely
on
daily
reconstructive
surgery
to
be
aesthetically
acceptable
,
strike
a
deal
with
the
federation
to
move
the
ba
'
ku
elsewhere
and
exploit
the
secret
to
keep
their
race
from
dying
.
that
'
s
when
captain
picard
(
patrick
stewart
)
steps
in
:
he
realizes
that
moving
the
ba
'
ku
would
kill
them
(
it
also
helps
that
he
falls
in
love
with
a
ba
'
ku
woman
(
donna
murphy
)
)
.
so
,
with
his
trusty
crew
,
picard
defies
the
federation
to
keep
the
ba
'
ku
in
their
natural
habitat
.
when
dealing
with
a
series
with
as
much
history
as
this
,
it
'
s
not
entirely
necessary
to
re
-
introduce
your
characters
with
each
episode
.
this
is
why
i
believe
non
-
fans
have
a
hard
time
getting
into
star
trek
;
in
order
to
enjoy
it
,
one
has
to
understand
how
to
approach
it
.
insurrection
,
however
,
does
a
surprisingly
good
job
of
us
new
aspects
of
the
characters
.
stewart
is
bold
as
always
,
a
magnetic
screen
presence
and
perfectly
capable
of
holding
an
entire
film
together
.
jonathan
frakes
,
who
also
directed
,
is
funny
as
commander
riker
;
a
subplot
with
data
(
brent
spiner
)
discovering
his
lost
childhood
is
fairly
interesting
;
and
abraham
makes
a
perfect
star
trek
villain
,
overacting
like
crazy
.
frakes
showed
similar
aptitude
for
direction
in
first
contact
;
insurrection
is
an
exciting
film
,
with
some
really
attractive
special
effects
and
a
lot
of
good
action
.
this
is
apparently
the
first
star
trek
film
to
utilize
computer
animation
,
and
the
result
is
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
:
particularly
in
the
climactic
scenes
,
in
which
the

giant
space
ship
to
suck
up
the
rings
of

the

a
clean
,
impressively
sharp
look
.
if
i
have
any
complaint
about
the
film
,
it
'
s
that
it
tries
to
take
a
moral
stance
when
it
'
s
not
very
appropriate
to
do
so

i
don

it

a
little
to
light
to
spring
these
kinds
of
big
moral
questions
on
the
audience
.
with
it

inherent
camp
factor
,
the
star

doesn

seem
well

from
ace
ventura
to
truman
burbank
,
jim
carrey
has
run
the
whole
gamut
of
comic
,
yet
sympathetic
,
characters
.
1996
'
s
the
cable
guy
was
supposed
to
be
his
big
"
breakthrough
"
role
from
zany
humor
into
darker
,
more
dramatic
acting
.
as
most
everyone
knows
,
the
results
were
,
well
,
less
-
than
-
stellar
.
not
only
did
the
film
not
do
so
hot
at
the
box
office
,
but
it
was
also
panned
by
critics
.
as
far
as
i
know
,
gene
siskel
and
i
are
the
only
ones
willing
to
admit
that
we
dug
it
.
the
first
time
i
saw
the
cable
guy
,
in
theatres
,
i
was
in
super
critic
-
mode
,
and
didn
'
t
really
like
it
.
however
,
due
to
the
fact
that
hbo
shows
the
movie
every
single
day
,
i
'
ve
had
time
to
lean
back
,
relax
,
and
take
in
the
film
.
and
to
my
surprise
,
it
grew
on
me
.
the
plot
is
rather
simple
:
broderick
plays
a
guy
named
steven
who
befriends
his
cable
guy
,
played
by
carrey
,
then
is
stalked
by
him
when
steven
tries
to
break
off
the
relationship
.
see
,
steven
'
s
been
having
some
problems
with
his
girlfriend
,
robin
(
leslie
mann
)
,
and
he
doesn
'
t
think
he
has
any
more
room
in
his
life
for
a
new
friend
.
also
,
some
of
the
cable
guy
'
s
antics
have
been
creeping
him
out
.
carrey
,
as
the
cable
guy
,
gives
steven
various
aliases
,
which
later
we
find
out
are
all
tv
characters
:
larry
tate
,
chip
douglas
,
ricky
ricardo
,
etc
.
he
apparently
lives
in
his
cable
van
,
and
while
many
critics
didn
'
t
enjoy
this
newer
,
darker
,
less
-
manic
performance
from
carrey
,
i
thought
it
was
interesting
and
rather
well
-
done
.
for
me
,
its
not
the
movie
as
a
whole
that
'
s
enjoyable
,
but
rather
several
individual
scenes
:
a
karaoke
jam
at
steven
'
s
apartment
,
a
medieval
fight
at
a
theme
restaurant
,
and
a
bathroom
beating
(
a
la
liar
,
liar
)
,
just
to
name
a
few
.
perhaps
the
fact
that
more
of
carrey
'
s
humorous
side
comes
out
during
these
scenes
is
what
makes
them
so
funny
.
and
if
you
really
want
to
see
something
,
you
'
ve
got
to
hear
his
version
of
jefferson
airplane
'
s
"
somebody
to
love
"
,
sung
at
the
aformentioned
karaoke
jam
.
the
cable
guy
has
its
bad
spots
,
like
most
any
movie
.
i
didn
'
t
particularly
like
steven
'
s
girlfriend
,
and
i
felt
that
more
focus
should
have
been
used
on
the
relationship
between
steven
and
his
best
friend
.
also
,
the
ending
,
while
having
you
fooled
for
a
moment
,
is
rather
contrived
,
and
somewhat
dissapointing
.
still
,
i
found
the
cable
guy
to
be
a
worthwhile
venture
;
if
you
'
re
at
the
video
store
and
can
'
t
think
of
anything
to
rent
,
i
suggest
you
try
it
out
.
or
if
you
have
hbo
,
just
wait
till
it
comes
on
(
you
won
'
t
have
to
wait
long
.
)
hell
,
that
'
s
what
i
do
every
day
.
when
bulworth
ended
,
i
allowed
myself
a
sigh
of
relief
:
?
it
is
possible
for
me
to
enjoy
political
satire
.
?
there
have
been
several
recent
political
films
that
didn
'
t
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
--
wag
the
dog
,
for
instance
,
i
found
to
be
an
intelligent
but
heartless
film
,
while
primary
colors
is
unbearable
and
unwatchable
in
its
awfulness
.
?
bulworth
is
a
far
better
film
than
these
,
both
in
its
execution
and
lasting
impression
.
?
it
'
s
a
tremendously
funny
and
intelligent
picture
,
but
it
also
has
an
emotional
center
--
writer
/
director
/
star
warren
beatty
allows
the
audience
to
identify
with
his
character
,
and
,
in
turn
,
we
like
him
and
actually
care
about
the
story
.
?
beatty
plays
incumbent
democratic
senator
jay
billington
bulworth
;
the
film
opens
and
we
see
bulworth
sobbing
as
he
watches
his
television
spots
over
and
over
again
.
?
he
hasn
'
t
slept
in
days
,
nor
has
he
eaten
,
and
,
almost
instantaneously
,
he
goes
insane
.
?
he
'
s
not
stark
raving
mad
(
not
outright
,
anyway
)
,
but
he
'
s
definitely
bonkers
.
?
it
'
s
the
final
weekend
of
his
campaign
,
and
his
assistant
,
murphy
(
oliver
platt
)
has
written
him
a
speech
to
feed
to
a
group
of
black
people
in
a
church
in
the
ghetto
.
?
bulworth
begins
the
speech
,
but
suddenly
goes
off
track
and
just
starts
being
honest
.
?
"
you
mean
,
"
one
lady
asks
,
"
the
democratic
party
doesn
'
t
care
about
the
african
american
community
?
"
?
"
well
,
"
he
shouts
,
laughing
,
"
isn
'
t
that
obvious
?
"
the
story
is
propelled
by
a
device
in
which
bulworth
puts
out
a
contract
on
his
own
life
(
he
muses
later
that
it
'
s
a
bad
thing
to
make
decisions
when
you
'
re
suicidal
)
;
he
keeps
seeing
a
man
in
sunglasses
(
graham
beckel
)
whom
he
believes
to
be
the
hitman
.
?
bulworth
also
meets
nina
(
halle
berry
)
with
whom
he
becomes
infatuated
.
?
suddenly
,
in
the
short
span
of
this
weekend
,
bulworth
'
s
no
-
nonsense
"
truth
in
politics
"
methods
become
a
national
sensation
,
and
he
shoots
ahead
in
the
polls
despite
the
fact
that
he
'
s
appearing
on
television
wearing
gang
clothes
and
spewing
more
profanity
than
coherent
sentences
.
beatty
'
s
work
on
both
sides
of
the
camera
is
excellent
.
?
his
script
and
direction
are
both
extremely
sharp
,
as
is
the
surprisingly
strong
characterization
of
bulworth
himself
.
?
here
is
a
man
who
'
s
reached
his
limit
,
and
his
way
of
lashing
back
is
by
screwing
over
the
entire
political
structure
.
?
i
like
that
the
film
doesn
'
t
take
a
clear
shot
at
any
of
the
political
parties
or
affiliations
,
but
at
politics
in
general
and
how
everything
is
run
by
the
rich
(
although
the
anti
-
rich
sentiments
do
get
a
bit
tiresome
by
the
end
of
the
film
)
.
?
some
of
the
segments
are
simply
hilarious
,
such
as
a
lengthy
rap
that
he
delivers
at
a
luncheon
dedicated
to
him
.
?
much
of
the
film
is
completely
absurd
,
but
that
'
s
the
fun
part
about
it
.
?
it
'
s
an
angry
,
serious
film
at
the
core
,
but
the
package
that
beatty
has
created
is
so
much
more
accessible
than
recent
attempts
in
the
genre
.
?
what
adds
to
this
feeling
is
beatty
'
s
portrayal
of
bulworth
;
this
is
a
performance
that
deserves
recognition
on
a
higher
scale
.
?
beatty
is
so
much
fun
to
watch
here
--
he
'
s
always
funny
,
but
he
'
s
also
subtle
in
ways
that
flesh
out
his
character
without
dialogue
or
hugely
noticeable
actions
.
?
beatty
is
so
good
that
bulworth
,
despite
his
shortcomings
as
a
human
being
,
is
an
entirely
sympathetic
and
likable
character
almost
from
the
beginning
.
the
supporting
cast
is
vast
and
colorful
.
?
berry
is
luminous
,
as
always
,
and
adds
to
her
repertoire
of
solid
supporting
roles
.
?
don
cheadle
has
a
good
role
as
a
drug
dealer
who
uses
gun
-
toting
toddlers
to
do
his
dirty
work
.
?
oliver
platt
is
an
actor
who
should
be
careful
,
for
someday
i
fear
he
may
induce
a
heart
attack
with
the
intensity
of
his
acting
(
though
he
'
s
very
funny
to
watch
)
.
?
paul
sorvino
adds
the
southern
accent
to
his
list
of
mastered
inflections
.
is
bulworth
offensive
?
?
i
suppose
some
may
see
it
that
way
.
?
i
wasn
'
t
offended
by
the
film
,
but
then
again
,
i
hardly
care
about
politics
.
?
i
think
that
people
who
find
this
film
offensive
will
just
be
blindsided
by
the
honesty
of
the
story
.
?
the
film
isn
'
t
perfect
,
of
course
--
the
ending
didn
'
t
quite
work
for
me
,
and
the
a
few
of
the
scenes
between
bulworth
and
nina
feel
forced
(
although
the
eclectic
dance
sequence
is
fantastic
)
.
?
but
these
are
minor
quibbles
about
an
otherwise
brilliant
film
.
?
bulworth
is
a
smart
,
uproariously
funny
picture
that
proves
to
me
that
political
satire
can
scratch
far
deeper
than
the
surface
.
?
call
911
for
the
cliche
police
if
you
must
,
but
the
eyes
are
the
window
to
the
soul
.
the
finest
actors
working
in
films
are
those
who
can
command
the
screen
with
a
gaze
:
paul
newman
,
ralph
fiennes
,
anthony
hopkins
,
morgan
freeman
.
you
look
at
these
men
on
screen
and
you
can
tell
without
them
saying
a
word
that
there
is
something
going
on
in
their
minds
,
that
the
characters
they
play
are
real
human
beings
.
we
will
never
have
a
chance
to
discover
if
tupac

unique

hall
has
some
interesting
things
to
say
about
what
we
expect
from

system
,
but
perhaps
not
enough
of
them
.
a
significant
chunk

devoted
to
spoon

stretch
'

flight
from

from

predictable

in
one
scene
,
stretch
scares
off

getting
chummy
with

that
old
chestnut
of

two
mistakenly
-
suspected
heroes
in
a
public
place
watching
a
television
news
report
of
the
crime
which
shows
their
pictures
.
the
entire
sequence
of
events
seems
designed
merely
as
an
excuse
to
get
spoon
and
stretch
running
,
while
the
other
primary
plot
has
them
standing
in
line

sitting
down

of

plays
with
gratuitous
inserts
of

paraphernalia

flashbacks
to
the

before

perhaps
making

to
point
out

talent

characters
are
wasting
through
self
-
destructive
behavior
.
oh
,
the
irony
of
it
.
tupac
shakur
made
a
career
in
music
and
movies
playing
the
hard
case
,
and
living
the
life
to
back
it
up

chance
to
play
someone
who
has
seen
enough
of
the
way
his
life
could
go
to
know
that
it
scares
him
.
spoon
is
an
idea
for
a
character
at
best
as
written
by
hall
,
but
shakur
displays
an
intelligence
and
survival
instinct
which
struggle
with
his
addiction
.
mostly
it
comes
through
those
eyes

eyes
with
none
of
the
hardness

might
expect
from
the
infamous
gangsta

it

no

who
is
watching
,
it
all
comes
back
to
the
talented
musicians
that
stir
your
soul
.
the
excitement
starts
before

when

band
is
tuning
up
,
a
member
remarks
,
"
finally

"
you
can
tell
just
by
watching
these
first
few
moments
that
this
show
isn
'
t
about
vanity
,
it
'

about
playing
the
music
you
love
to
those
who
have
an
appreciation
for
it

two

.
this
interaction
between
audience
and
performer
continues
throughout
the
film
and
becomes
infectious
to
the
audience
.
it
'

impossible
to
tear
your
eyes
away
from
janis
joplin
as
she
belts
out
her
ballad
about
love
being
a
ball
and
chain
.
and
while
the
lyrics
to
"

thing
"
may
not
be
all
that
complicated
,
watching
jimi
hendrix
mime
having
sex
with
his
guitar
is
as
captivating
as
otis
redding
singing
about
love
.
even
if
you
don

recognize
every
band
you
see
on
stage
,
you
can
imagine
being
as
enthralled
by
their
work
as
the
public
sitting
in
those
seats
.
the
only
drawback
to

the
most
common
(
and

cases
the
only
)
complaint
against
francis
ford
coppola
'
s
1972
masterpiece
the
godfather
is
glamorising
of
mafia
,
which
is
presented
as

institution
guided
by
ancient
tradition
and
virtues
like
honour
,
loyalty
and
solidarity
more
suitable
for
some
gentler
,
kinder
ages
.
martin
scorsese
,
another
italoamerican
moviemaker
,
confronted
that
perspective
with
his
own
,
more
down
-
to
-
earth
vision
of
mafia
in
1973
mean
streets
,
movie
that
dealt
with
lower
echelons
of
organised
crime
.
unfortunately
for
scorsese
,
his
film
was
unspectacular
and
too
artsy
to
compete
with
coppola
'
s
influence
on
mafia
portrayals
in
the
movies
.
seventeen
years
later
scorsese
returned
to
mean
streets
of
new
york
with
another
film
that
dealt
with
darker
side
of
american
organised
crime
.
this
film
was
goodfellas
,
epic
black
comedy
which
is
today
considered
as
one
of
the
best
and
most
influential
films
of
1990s
.
goodfellas
owes
some
of
its
initial
success
and
popularity
to
the
fact
that
it
was
based
on
the
true
story
,
told
in
best
-
seller
book
wiseguy
by
nicholas
pileggi
(
who
would
co
-
write
the
screenplay
for
the
film
)
.
the
book
,
as
well
as
the
film
,
chronicled
thirty
years
in
the
life
of
henry
hill
(
played
by
ray
liotta
)
,
irish
-
italian
criminal
from
new
york
.
at
the
age
of
13
he
gets
recruited
in
the
criminal
organisation
of
paulie
cicero
(
played
by
paul
sorvino
)
,
local
mob
boss
,
and
gradually
climbs
up
the
ladder
starting
with
small
errands
.
after
couple
of
years
,
together
with
his
best
childhood
friend
tommy
de
vito
(
played
by
joe
pesci
)
,
he
joins
the
crew
of
expert
thieves
led
by
jimmy
conway
(
played
by
robert
de
niro
)
.
three
of
them
spend
years
as
best
friends
and
associates
,
gathering
enormous
wealth
from
their
criminal
enterprises
that
would
culminate
with
one
of
the
most
spectacular
robberies
in
american
history
.
wealth
,
influence
and
privileges
of
men
connected
with
mafia
are
enough
for
henry
hill
to
seduce
his
future
wife
karen
(
played
by
lorraine
bracco
)
,
who
would
afterwards
remain
loyal
to
her
husband
despite
infidelities
,
domestic
abuse
,
arrests
and
would
even
be
accomplice
to
his
own
private
drug
dealing
business
.
but
the
perfect
world
of
"
wiseguys
"
gradually
begins
to
fall
apart
-
tommy
'
s
unpredictable
outbursts
of
homicidal
violence
,
jimmy
'
s
reluctance
to
share
his
part
of
the
loot
with
partners
and
,
finally
,
henry
'
s
own
drug
habit
would
lead
to
his
downfall
and
make
him
question
his
loyalty
to
the
friends
.
goodfellas
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
film
that
represents
work
of
a
film
genius
in
his
full
glory
.
scorsese
managed
to
create
a
vision
which
is
effective
and
complete
despite
being
full
of
contradictions
that
would
ripped
the
film
apart
in
the
hands
of
less
talented
filmmaker
.
world
depicted
in
this
film
is
both
ordinary
and
fascinating
.
scorsese
spares
no
effort
to
show
us
all
the
violence
,
hypocrisy
and
inherent
paranoia
of
organised
crime
,
yet
it
manages
to
make
it
both
seductive
and
funny
.
after
being
exposed
to
two
and
half
hours
of
the
film
and
three
decades
of
criminal
history
(
based
on
some
notorious
real
life
events
)
,
the
audience
understands
why
the
characters
chose
such
dangerous
life
paths
,
trading
the
superficial
and
short
-
lasting
glamour
and
prosperity
of
a
criminal
to
the
dullness
and
poverty
of
honest
citizens
.
scorsese
also
manages
to
break
viewer
'
s
moralistic
inhibitions
by
showing
truly
revolting
material
-
scenes
that
depict
personal
tragedies
,
broken
homes
,
human
depravity
,
violence
,
bloodshed
and
murder
-
in
all
their
uncompromising
reality
,
but
in
a
manner
that
would
make
it
amusing
and
funny
to
the
audience
.
with
the
use
of
ironic
soundtrack
,
manipulative
shots
,
character
'
s
dialogue
or
narrator
'
s
commentary
,
goodfellas
represents
the
new
standards
of
black
humour
that
would
became
very
popular
few
years
later
during
tarantino
era
.
even
if
we
don
'
t
pay
attention
to
skills
with
which
potentially
disturbing
material
becomes
eye
pleasing
and
entertaining
,
we
should
admit
that
scorsese
displays
his
talents
of
truly
original
and
creative
filmmaker
.
first
,
we
might
notice
unusual
structure
of
the
plot
-
relatively
minor
subplot
is
used
as
movie
'
s
ironic
prologue
.
then
,
instead
of
single
narrator
,
scorsese
switches
to
the
second
character
as
narrator
in
the
middle
of
the
film
only
to
switch
back
to
the
original
shortly
afterwards
.
this
multiple
points
of
views
,
both
in
terms
of
narration
and
various
subjective
shots
,
only
lengthens
the
ironic
distance
towards
characters
and
their
situation
.
same
ironic
distance
comes
with
extremely
effective
choice
of
soundtrack
.
nostalgia
for
good
old
times
is
illustrated
with
easy
-
listening
1950s
pop
songs
,
while
depression
,
paranoia
and
bad
times
find
their
expression
in
more
neurotic
rock
songs
of
late
1960s
and
1970s
.
but
the
soundtrack
is
most
effective
when
it
is
used
as
ironic
comment
-
almost
pastoral
,
easy
listening
tunes
make
strong
and
very
ironic
contrast
to
the
scenes
of
violence
and
bloodshed
.
however
,
thing
most
associated
with
this
film
is
couple
of
continuos
shots
that
feature
characters
moving
through
large
rooms
and
interacting
with
dozens
if
not
hundreds
of
people
.
such
scenes
,
although
they
require
very
great
skill
and
patience
during
their
shootings
,
became
very
popular
among
other

which
doesn

t
have

instead
bases

another
essential
element
of

superb

of
great
acting
talents

the
most
respectable
among
them
is
robert

but
his
character
,
who
happen
to
be
most
quiet

overshadowed
by

of

joe

supporting

and
his
lines

,
probably
represent
the
most
memorable
element
of

,
although
equally
talented
,
perhaps
doesn

look
as
the
best
choice
for
narrator

nominal

improves

very
realistic
and
menacing
portrayal

lorraine

is
,
on

,
very
effective
and
believable
as
karen

,
wife
who
gradually
descends
into

moral
cesspool

paul
sorvino
is
also
very
effective

among
the
supporting

most
memorable
is

digs

as
a
combination
of
clever
sociological

,
black
humour
and
innovative
filmmaking
goodfellas
became
something
only
the
truly
great
films
could
do
-
work
of
art
and
excellent
popular
entertainment
in

time
.
because
of
this
achievement
,
and
also
because
of
the
great
influence
on
future
filmmakers
,
this
cinematic
gem
deserves
its
rightful
place
among
the
best
films
of
1990s
.
"
the
blair
witch
project
"
was
perhaps
one
of
a
kind
,
a
unique
film
that
played
completely
on
its
own
merit
,
managing
to
scare
even
the
most
experienced
horror
fans
out
of
their
senses
.
its
success
made
a
sequel
inevitable
,
but
this
is
not
the
sequel
,
i
suspect
,
anyone
much
wanted
.
after
the
release
of
"
the
blair
witch
project
"
,
tourists
have
practically
invaded
the
small
town
of
burkettsville
,
in
order
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
blair
witch
.
locals
have
turned
this
mass
hysteria
into
a
great
business
opportunity
,
selling
twig
-
sculptures
,
stones
and
dirt
like
those
in
the
movie
,
and
the
exasperated
local
sheriff
patrols
the
woods
with
a
bullhorn
,
shouting
,
"
get
out
of
these
woods
and
go
home
!
there
is
no
goddamned

jeff
(
)
is
one
of
those
people
,
who
has
used
the
sudden
popularity
of
the
small
town
to
his
advantage
.
after
he
got
released
from
the
mental
institution
,
he
created
a
mobile
business
that
attracts
thousands
of
customers
through
the
internet

as

movie
starts
he
is
leading
one
of
these
groups
into

on

"

the
last
member
of

is
erica

a
young
beautiful
witch

wannabe
,
who
constantly
quotes
from
the

,
do
no

because
whatever

"
this
strange
group
plunges
into
the
woods
,
where
they
begin
to
argue
about
their
different
approaches
to
the
experience
.
on
the
very
first
night

they

spend
under

they
are

lost
in

it

uncontrollably
back

forth

they
are
all
haunted
by
hallucinations
and
horrible
nightmares
and
soon
they
can
not
see
the
difference
between
dreams
and

the
opening
scenes
--
the
documentary
showing
the

by
the

--
is
a
more
promising
approach
,
because
instead
of
trying
to
cover
similar
ground
,
it
goes
outside
the
first
film
and
makes
its
own
stand
.
but
soon
the
movie
gets
confused
and
sidetracked
by
its
own
story
,
that
is
never
resolved
and
ends
with
a
very
anticlimaxic
epilogue
.
in
a
way
,
this
is
a
typical
hollywood
sequel
.
more
money
has
been
spent
and
more
people
have
worked
on
a
project
that
was
doomed
to
fail
.
the
horror
and
suspense
of
the
original
simply
could
not
be
repeated
.
of
course
in
these
situations
,
quantity
is
more
important
than
quality
and

is
more
important

you
realize
that
with
the

of

this

has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with

"

filmed

was
mostly
based
on
improvisation
.
in
the
sequel
the
technical
aspect
of
the
film
is
close
to
perfection
,
creating
a
completely
different
atmosphere
.
with
its
graceful
cinematography
,
production
design
and
flashy
editing
,
the
film
has
a
very
polished
look
,
which
is
impossible
to
associate
with
the
first
installment
.
and
though
berlinger
directs
his
film
with
an
energy
and
pace
that
makes
the
adrenaline
rush
through
the
body
a
couple
of
times
,
he
has
obviously
misunderstood
the
nature
of
his
predecessor
.
the
key
is
simplicity
.
"
blair
witch
project
"
had
a
story
which
was
incredibly
simple
.
that
allowed
the
audience
to
fill
the
gaps
with
our
own
imagination
.
the
film
was
practically
an
empty
screen
,
on
which
we
projected
our
most
frightening
nightmares
.
the
effect
was
incredibly
powerful
,
lasting
and
entir
e
everyone
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
"
book
of
shadows
"
feels
incredibly
controlled
and
restrict
.
here
,
very
little
is
left
to
our
imagination
and
the
story
is
so
complex
and
"
clever
"
that
the
screenwriters
are
the
first
to
get
lost
in
it
.
there
is
is
no
book
of
shadows
and
no
conclusion
that
we
can
be
satisfied
with
.
this
is
simply
a
less
artistic
film
that
doesn
'
t
have
the
talent
and
originality
of
its
predecessor
.
it
resorts
to
fancy
cinematography
and
special
effects
to
create
the
right
effect
and
doesn
'
t
always
succeed
.
but
most
importantly
:
it
stands
on
its
own
ground
and
has
almost
no
connection
with
the
first
movie
,
which
doesn
'
t
allow
it
to
destroy
the
original
.
in
the
end
,
i
can
'
t
call
it
a
bad
effort
.
it
'
s
less
artistic
,
not
so
scary
and
less
original
,
but
certainly
not
bad
.
it
'
s
simply
different
.
in
fact
,
if
you
haven
'
t
seen
"
the
blair
witch
project
"
,
you
might
like
this
film
for
what
it
is
--
a
cross
between
"
the
blair
witch
project
"
and
the
"
scream
"
-
films
.
the
only
element
that
remains
constant
and
similar
between
the
two
films
is
the
solid
acting
(
jeffrey
donovan
and
tristine
skyler
should
be
mentioned
)
and
incredible
sense
of
surrealism
.
but
it
'
s
a
common
knowledge
and
experience
that
,
with
a
few
exceptions
,
every
movie
sequel
is
worse
than
the
original
and
some
are
even
not
worth
making
.
to
me
the
story
of
"
the
blair
witch
project
"
seemed
completed
,
but
there
are
obviously
no
limits
to
commercial
success
that
"
the

certainly
assured

one
of
the
best
things
about
the
movies
is
that
they
can
make
you
really
start
to
wonder
and
analyze
things
in
your
own
,
everyday
life
that
you
might
not
have
thought
much
of
otherwise
.
with
some
films
it
might
be
just
a
secondary
issue
,
but
with
`
dark
city
'
what
we
get
is
nearly
an
entire
film
committed
to
philosophizing
and
theorizing
about
human
memory
and
how
it
defines
who
we
are
,
which
is
a
poignant
theme
made
through
an
absolutely
beautifully
-
constructed
film
with
the
kind
of
story
and
setting
that
could
only
happen
in
a
movie
.
there
'
s
an
old
role
-
playing
computer
game
called
`
d
?
ja
v
?
'
wherein
the
player
takes
on
the
role
of
a
man
who
can
'
t
remember
who
he
is
,
where
he
is
and
how
he
got
there
.
the
goal
is
to
gather
as
many
clues
as
possible
to
figure
that
out
and
along
the
way
overcome
a
conflict
.
the
premise
to
this
film
is
not
unlike
that
game
,
only
this
time
we
don
'
t
have
control
over
the
protagonist
.
we
begin
by
meeting
a
seemingly
ordinary
man
living
in
an
extremely
dark
and
dirty
city
(
actually
,
it
'
s
more
than
just
the
city
,
it
'
s
the
whole
reality
)
that
isn
'
t
just
that
neo
-
gothic
look
(
a
la
`
batman
,
'
`
blade
runner
,
'
)
,
but
is
so
fully
developed
it
'
s
almost
a
different
genre
completely
.
later
he
will
learn
that
his
name
is
john
murdoch
(
sewell
)
,
but
for
now
he
has
no
idea
what
'
s
going
on
other
than
the
fact
something
is
not
right
.
the
fact
there
'
s
a
dead
body
in
the
corner
goes
to
enhance
the
feeling
of
paranoia
and
a
mysterious
,
hurried
call
telling
him
to
leave
immediately
is
also
very
chilling
.
this
opening
scene
alone
goes
a
long
way
to
define
the
setting
of
the
film
and
its
bizarre
,
horrific
tone
.
the
man
doesn
'
t
know
who
he
is
nor
where
he
'
s
going
and
it
'
s
interesting
to
follow
him
since
we
the
viewers
have
no
idea
either
we
can
sympathize
and
identify
with
him
.
in
fact
,
this
is
the
way
all
stories
begin
since
it
'
s
impossible
to
know
the
history
of
a
character
,
their
feelings
,
values
,
morals
,
etc
.
until
after
we
'
ve
observed
them
for
a
while
.
but
in
this
case
,
the
total
feeling
of
amnesia
is
an
excellent
tool
towards
characterization
,
developing
the
mood
and
outlining
the
story
.
eventually
,
some
semblance
of
a
plot
begins
to
unfold
as
it
appears
that
john
is
a
serial
killer
wanted
by
the
police
.
we
met
inspector
frank
bumstead
(
hurt
)
,
a
quiet
,
unemotional
,
soft
-
spoken
deadpan
man
who
appears
to
have
been
on
the
trail
of
the
killer
for
some
time
.
two
other
important
characters
are
also
introduced
:
dr
.
daniel
p
.
schreber
(
sutherland
)
,
a
neurotic
psychiatrist
who
claims
to
be
john
'
s
doctor
;
and
emma
murdoch
(
connelly
)
,
a
jazz
singer
dolled
up
to
look
like
a
caraciture
right
out
of
the
old
dick
tracy
serials
or
any
given
leading
lady
of
the
old
film
-
noir
movies
.
it
was
schreber
who
contacted
john
for
reasons
that
are
continually
revealed
throughout
the
course
of
the
film
.
he
also
contacts
emma
,
which
further
helps
the
film
reveal
what
is
seemingly
a
complex
,
mysterious
back
story
.
but
absolutely
nothing
is
as
it
appears
to
be
in
`
dark
city
,
'
which
is
what
makes
it
so
fascinating
throughout
its
continual
scenes
of
confusion
and
vertigo
.
everything
the
filmmakers
want
us
to
see
has
some
significance
-
considering
how
intricate
the
detail
is
to
every
single
shot
,
its
lighting
,
art
direction
and
overall
production
design
,
they
don
'
t
seem
to
be
able
to
afford
any
gratuities
.
however
,
that
might
also
be
what
'
s
keeping
it
from
reaching
its
maximum
potential
.
by
continuing
to
follow
john
as
he
wanders
around
this
strange
place
,
so
much
unlike
the
real
world
we
know
,
we
come
to
realize
that
it
'
s
all
a
hoax
.
everyone
in
the
city
is
the
subject
of
an
experiment
being
conducted
by
a
race
of
aliens
to
understand
what
makes
humans
tick
in
their
efforts
to
somehow
save
themselves
from
extinction
.
but
,
as
the
film
'
s
tagline
says
,
`
last
night
,
one
of
us
went
off
.
'
for
reasons
that
are
never
clearly
explained
,
it
appears
that
john
possesses
telekinetic
powers
to
can
do
pretty
much
whatever
his
mind
can
conceive
(
a
process
known
as
`
tuning
'
)
.
the
aliens
,
which
look
like
very
old
bald
human
men
with
pasty
skin
,
also
possess
the
power
en
masse
and
use
it
to
change
the
city
every
night
at
midnight
.
at
the
same
time
all
the
humans
fall
asleep
and
after
the
changes
are
made
,
they
awake
and
either
continue
where
they
left
off
or
begin
a
new
life
they
have
no
idea
they
did
not
have
until
then
.
this
premise
certainly
is
interesting
and
director
and
co
-
screenwriter
alex
proyas
is
able
to
keep
the
film
consistently
mysterious
in
this
regard
.
he
does
provide
some
explanations
such
as
that
dr
.
schreber
is
an
assistant
to
`
the
strangers
'
because
he
somehow
could
synthesize
memory
into
chemical
form
.
the
aliens
mix
and
match
the
memories
of
the
city
'
s
population
to
see
who
will
change
and
who
will
not
.
in
the
process
this
creates
for
a
good
deal
of
deep
,
thought
-
provoking
philosophies
that
could
be
applied
to
the
real
world
.
however
,
where
the
film
errs
is
by
not
playing
up
the
idea
of
memory
versus
the
human
heart
as
to
what
makes
a
person
who
he
or
she
is
.
the
main
characters
are
all
closely
intertwined
within
the
seemingly
complex
murder
mystery
which
never
actually
happened
,
yet
when
they
start
to
go
through
some
of
the
expected
emotions
it
comes
off
as
distant
,
static
and
cold
(
mediocre
performances
by
hurt
and
connelly
don
'
t
help
either
)
.
for
example
,
john
realizes
emma
is
not
and
probably
never
was
his
wife
so
he
does
not
feel
an
emotional
bond
to
her
,
yet
in
some
scenes
crucial
to
the
film
'
s
plot
,
we
are
expected
to
believe
they
do
have
a
genuine
love
for
each
other
,
which
is
also
part
of
the
film
'
s
climax
and
ending
.
and
that
'
s
what
proyas
seems
to
be
inferring
with
the
film
,
but
never
quite
manages
to
convey
in
its
fullest
sense
.
ironically
,
this
is
what
made
his
first
film
`
the
crow
'
work
so
well
,
which
had
a
similar
theme
of
struggling
to
find
hope
and
the
human
spirit
within
a
nearly
identical
,
dark
twisted
world
.
with
`
dark
city
'
the
messenger
seems
to
be
mistaken
for
the
message
.
still
,
the
film
is
by
no
means
bad
and
is
consistently
entertaining
and
enjoyable
.
there
'
s
a
lot
to
like
here
,
most
notably
the
sheer
visual
look
and
style
of
it
all
which
accounts
for
at
least
half
the
reasons
the
film
is
able
to
tell
the
story
it
does
.
the
story
as
a
whole
is
one
of
the
most
original
to
come
out
of
hollywood
in
years
.
`
dark
city
'
is
what
the
movies
are
all
about
-
the
escape
from
the
real

wings
of
desire
this
ain

t
.
since
debuting
with
clerks
,
smith
has
grown
as
a
director
,
particularly
in
terms
of
working
with
actors
.
(
chris
rock
is
this
film
'
s
only
weak
link
-
between
jokes
,
he
'

wooden
.
)
his
no
-
frills
visual
style
hasn
'
t
changed
much
over
the
years
,
though
(
dogma
'
s
widescreen
compositions
at
least
have
blockbuster
affectations
)
,
nor
has
his
writing
-
his
characters
still
sit
around
delivering
one
caustic
,
hilarious
speech
after
another
.
dogma
chips
away
at
big
religious
issues
-
namely
,
the
hypocrisy
that
accompanies
any
organized
system
of
beliefs
-
eloquently
and
articulately
,
but
a
few
of
the
monologues
sound
too
much
like
blatant
exposition
.
as
well
,
the
verbal
introduction
of
each
new
person
seems
to
take
forever
.
any
movie
with
this
much
weighty
talk
would
have
a
hard
time
maintaining
momentum
(
hurlyburly
,
anyone
?
)
,
and
eventually
dogma
'
s
pacing
goes
slack
.
a
long
diatribe
from
bartleby
late
in
the
game
,
in
which
he
laments
the
destiny
of
celestial
beings
,
comes
at
a
point
when
we
'
ve
heard
enough
.
because
his
change
of
heart
(
bartleby
is
initially
the
good
cop
to
loki
'
s
bad
)
drives
the
climax
,
said
rant
is
given
a
great
deal
of
screen
time
.
sure
,
affleck
deserved
a
big
moment
(
damon
steals
their
scenes
together
prior
)
,
but
it
ultimately
makes
the
film
and
us
feel
bloated
.
like
tarantino
,
smith
was
a
video
-
age
sponge
who
became
a
sample
-
mad
indie
filmmaker
.
dogma
pays
welcome
homage
to
an
eclectic
batch
of
movies
,
including
indiana
jones
and
the
last
crusade
,
with
silent
bob
doing
his
best
harrison
ford
,
and
weird
science
-
a
shit
demon
attacks
our
heroes
!
smith
also
has
a
kitchen
sink
brand
of
humour
:
his
dexterous
maneuvering
between
the
satirical
(
a
cardinal
played
by
george
carlin
attempts
to
mount
a
publicity
campaign
with
the
slogan
"
catholicism

"
)
and
the
scatalogical
ensures
that
no
lover
of
comedy
will
leave

feeling
malnourished
.

proceedings
also
get
off
on
the
right
foot
with
the
opening
with
the
funniest
disclaimer
ever
.
it
'
s
a
disclaimer
unlikely
to
put
protestors
at
ease
,
for
to
read
it
,
one
actually
has
to
see
dogma
.
the
prerelease
ballyhoo
is
in
the
tradition
of
the
last
temptation
of
christ
'
s
,
martin
scorsese
'
s
1988
adaptation
of
nikos
kazantzakis
'
controversial
novel
,
in
that
it
is
not
directly
linked
to
the
picture
'
s
content
but
to
rumours
and
heresy
.
there
'
s
a
famous
anecdote
about
fletch
director
michael
ritchie
inviting
picketers
of
the
last
temptation
of
christ
into
a
screening
on
his
dime
,
just
so
they
could
know
for
certain
what
they
were
rallying
against
.
(
not
one
of
them
had
watched
it
.
)
every
single
person
refused
.
smith
and
scorsese
have
a
lot
in
common
,
and
so
do
the
two
films
in
question
,
because
both
smith
'
s
bethany
and
scorsese
'
s
jesus
are
hollow
shells
without
their
faith
.
in
fact
,
dogma
'
s
denouement
(
which
follows
a
thrilling
showdown
that
'
s
worth
the
wait
)
is
a
catholic
love
-
in
,
a
veritable
recruitment
poster
.
(
i
felt
sentimental
about
a
religion
i
don
'
t
belong
to
.
now
that
'
s
powerful
filmmaking
.
)
smith
is
nothing
if
not
sincere
about
his
own
devotion
to
god
,
and
that
spirituality
shines
through
.
it
'
s
enough
to
make
me
forgive
dogma
for
its
editorial
sins
.
my
religion
is
movies
.
when
the
catholic
league
beats
on
dogma
for
imaginary
crimes
against
a
doctrine
,
in
a
roundabout
way
they
'
re
attacking
what
i
live
for
:
freedom
of
expression
through
celluloid
.
i
therefore
feel
that
,
although
i
'
m
no
bible
-
thumper
,
i
'
m
at
least
as
qualified
to
criticize
dogma
as
william
donohue
and
his
followers
.
you
'

heard
all
the
hype

you

if
you

any
reviews
,
you
'

also
probably
heard
that
this
movie
fails
to
live
up
to
the
magic
and
humanity
of
the
first
trilogy
.
you
also
may
have
heard
that

and
doesn

have

the

are
stunning
,
the
digitalized

are
amazingly
realistic
,
the

duels
are
amazing
,
and
queen
amidala
'
s
sumptuous
robes
are
fit
to
be
worn
by
queen
elizabeth
.
but
there
'
s
something
missing
here
,
and
it
isn
'
t
budget
or
effects
-
it
'
s
everything
money
*
can
'
t
*
buy
.
the
actors
struggle
as
best
they
can
to
flesh
out
broad
-
stroked
and
flat
characters
.
the
most
successful
at
this
is
liam
neeson
who
,
as
qui
-
gon
jinn
,
a
jedi
master
to
young
obi
-
wan
kenobi
,
has
quiet
dignity
and
a
wise
,
commanding
presence
.
he
is
the
anchor
to
this
movie
,
as
he
is
the
one
character
who
george
lucas
apparently
spent
some
time
fleshing
out
.
portman
'
s
queen
amidala
and
mcgregor
'
s
obi

so
well
.
amidala
,
the
future
mother
of
luke
and
leia
and
the
queen
of
a
peaceful
planet
being
invaded
by
the
trade
federation
(
?
!
?
)
,
comes
off
as
stoic
,
stilted
and
caricatured
(
it
appears
as
though
she
was
a
vulcan
geisha
in
a
former
life
)
.
and
obi
-
wan
,
although
mcgregor
makes
him
very
endearing
,
has
so
little
screen
time
that
he
'
s
nothing
but
a
robin
to
qui
-
gon
jinn
'

batman
.
however
,
mcgregor
does
struggle
manfully
to
infuse
this
surprisingly
small
supporting
role
with
a
spark
of
genuine
insight
and
humanity
,
and
he
does
a
good
job
.
he
also
absolutely
nails
alec
guiness
'
(
obi

)
scottish
accent
,
and
that
really
makes
his
presence
in
the
film
more
profound
than
it
might
have
been
otherwise
.
in
fact
,
lucas
seems
to
bank
on
that
preexisting
knowledge
quite
a
bit
,
and
that
'
s
one
of
the
problems
with
this
film
.
i
would
never
call
myself
a
"
star
wars
"
fan
-
especially
not
considering
what
it
means
to
be
a
fanatic
these
days
-
but
i
'
ve
always
enjoyed
the
films
along
with
everyone
else
in
america
.
however
,
if
you
are
the
one
person
in
america
who
*
hasn
'
t
*
seen
the
films
at
all
or
even
recently
,
or
who
doesn
'
t
bother
to
brush
-
up
on
the
names
of
obscure
characters
,
you
may
be
hopelessly
lost
.
for
example
,
one
of
the
film
'
s
main
(
nefarious
)
characters
is
senator
palpatine
.
for
those
of
you
not
recently
steeped
in
"
star
wars
"
trivia
,
emperor
palpatine
is
that
scary
hooded
apparition
who
was
darth
vader
'
s
master
in
"
return
of
the
jedi
"
and
"
empire
strikes
back
.
"
so
,
obviously
,
his
appearance
in
"
phantom
menace
"
is
meant
to
stir
some
echoes
of
his
later
role
in
the
series
,
thus
making
his
role
here
more
meaningful
.
a
lot
of
the
movie
is
like
that
.
r2
-
d2
and
c
-
3po
make
token
appearances
,
and
it
'
s
obvious
that
lucas
is
banking
on
the
audience
'
s
pre
-
existing
fondness
for
them
.
.
.
because
he
doesn
'
t
do
much
to
add
to
it
in
any
way
.
same
goes
for
jabba
the
hutt
,
who
doesn
'
t
look
as
much
mean
here
as
he
does
corpulent
and
lazy
.
even
*
planets
*
make
foreshadowing
guest
appearances
in
this
film
-
tatooine
(
the
desert
world
where
luke
grew
up
)
,
coruscant
(
the
cloud
city
from
"
empire
strikes
back
"
)
,
and
alderaan
(
leia
'
s
home
planet
-
which
we
never
actually
see
-
that
gets
blown
up
in
"
star
wars
"
)
show
up
or
are
mentioned
briefly
in
passing
.
what
'
s
the
result
of
tying
so
many
plot
points
and
characters
to
future
films
?
the
answer
is
that
this
one
seems
surprisingly
empty
.
there
'
s
no
meat
-
no
substance
-
that
makes
you
want
to
love
the
characters
as
they
are
,
not
as
they
will
be
.
another
problem
is
that
there
are
actually
*
too
many
*
alien
characters
in
the
film
.
i
was
distracted
by
the
fact
that
two
of
the
main
evil
characters
-
strange
looking
aliens
who
looked
like
gila
monsters
-
had
mouths
that
barely
moved
,
making
them
look
more
like
muppets
than
actual
characters
.
and
jar
jar
binks
,
a
silly
roger
rabbitish
amphibious
character
,
is
intended
as
comic
relief
,
but
what
he
really
becomes
is
annoying
-
and
fast
.
unlike
chewbacca
and
c
-
3po
,
who
got
their
humanity
(
if
you
'
ll
pardon
the
expression
)
from
their
interactions
with
the
human
characters
,
jar
jar
is
often
left
to
interact
mostly
with
others
of
his
kind
,
at
times
making
the
movie
seem
like
nothing
more
than
a
very
expensive
"
teenage
mutant
ninja
turtles
.
"
furthermore
,
the
dialogue
is
often
stilted
and
corny
,
and
sometimes
downright
infantile
,
thereby
rendering
some
characters
into
nothing
more
than
bystanders
to
the
plot
.
oddly
,
this
isn
'
t
just
*
my
*
judgment
-
lucas
has
said
that
he
designed
this
film
for
kids
.
well
,
he
'
s
done
a
good
job
.
the
hero
of
this
film
,
of
course
,
is
young
anakin
,
but
it
was
very
hard
for
me
to
feel
any
kinship
or
identify
with
an
eight
-
year
-
old
boy
.
that
'
s
not
jake
lloyd
'
s
fault
,
though
-
he
does
a
good
job
of
being
a
cute
kid
,
which
is
apparently
all
lucas
asked
of
him
.
that
'
s
another
mistake
,
of
course
,
because
the
cute
tyke
becomes
darth
vader
.
warning
:
spoilers
ahead
!
!
!
!
in
my
opinion
,
there
was
not
nearly
enough
foreshadowing
of
anakin
'
s
future
evil
in
the
film
.
the
boy
is
all
blond
flowing
hair
and
rosy
cheeks
,
and
there
'
s
nothing
more
than
a
spark
of
aggression
in
him
throughout
the
entire
movie
.
he
has
a
doting
mother
(
pernilla
august
,
making
her
first
english
-
language
film
)
and
is
a
slave
to
a
gross
flying
gnome
on
tatooine
.
but
the
only
indication
the
audience
gets
that
this
kid
isn

all

is

did
this

is
it

absolutely

then
this

this

next

:
)
as
african
american
detective
vergil
tibbs
questions
a
suspected
white
murderer
inside
a
jail
cell
,
there
is
a
wonderful
,
eye
-
catching
shot
which
instantaneously
presents
the
main
message
of
the
entire
film
.
the
shot
has
tibbs
'
face
completely
covered
by
the
shadows
of
the
prison
bars
.
to
see
these
bars
blocking
his
face
,
we
see
how
separated
tibbs
is
from
the
rest
of
the
characters
in
the
film
.
as
a
black
detective
conducting
an
investigation
in
a
southern
town
full
of
violent
white
bigots
,
no
matter
how
innocent
tibbs
is
,
he
is
still
seen
by
these
bigots
as
a
threat
simply
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin
.
the
bars
show
that
tibbs
has
not
been
given
a
fair
chance
to
show
exactly
who
he
is
,
instead
others
have
chosen
him
as
different
and
dangerous
.
this
one
shot
amazes
me
because
it
captures
a
whole
theme
in
a
matter
of
seconds
.
it
perhaps
may
be
the
most
powerful
image
i
have
seen
in
a
film

"
in
the
heat
of
the
night
"
was
the
first
and
the
best
of
the
three
films
norman
jewison
directed
concerning
racism
in
america
.
jewison
has
a
very
keen
style
of
displaying
various
cases
of
racism
as
he
is
neither
pedantic
nor
overly
sentimental
.
in
these
three
films
he
does
an
excellent
job
creating
very
detailed
equal
analyses
of
characters
from
the
abused
to
the
abusers
.
he
is
also
not
afraid
to
tell
the
absolute
truth
about
how
corrupt
society
was
in
the
past
and
is
in
the
present
.
preceding
the
very
original
"
a
soldier
'
s
story
"
and
the
recently
released
"
the
hurricane
,
"
"
in
the
heat
of
the
night
contains
some
classic
lines
and
some
very
memorable
characters
.
the
film
,
which
won
best
picture
in
1967
focuses
on
vergil
tibbs
,
played
superbly
by
sidney
poitier
as
a
fearless
african
american
police
officer
from
philadelphia
who
refuses
to
give
up
on
an
investigation
in
a
white
town
where
is
he
not
wanted
.
tibbs
is
a
man
who
rarely
loses
his
temper
and
that
is
worth
mentioning
because
he
is
constantly
facing
abuse
from
those
around
him
.
as
a
hero
who
is
not
afraid
to
face
off
against
five
men
with
chains
,
tibbs
is
the
perfect
protagonist
.
poitier
also
gives
an
excellent
,
noteworthy
voice
to
his
character
.
never
nervous
and
always
commanding
,
his
speech
patterns
are
very
manipulative
as
they
range
from
stentorian
to
soothing
.
however
,
unlike
"
the
hurricane
"
where
denzel
washington
dominated
over
the
rest
of
the
cast
,
poitier
shares
the
spotlight
with
rod
steiger
,
who
won
best
actor
for
his
excellent
performance
.
as
a
sheriff
who
helps
tibbs
and
warns
him
of
the
dangers
around
him
,
steiger
shows
a
great
amount
of
skill
in
his
role
.
he
starts
off
as
racist
and
blind
as
the
other
townspeople
.
he
would
refer
to
tibbs
as
"
boy
"
and
would
always
suspiciously
keep
an
eye
on
him
.
as
the
film
progresses
though
,
there
is
a
very
gradual
change
in
the
sheriff
.
he
begins
to
see
the
hardships
tibbs
faces
and
he
sees
the
foolishness
of
his
own
neighbors
.
what
i
really
enjoyed
about
steiger
'
s
character
was
that
he
did
not
completely
abandon
his
friends
or
connect
with
tibbs
at
the
end
of
the
film
.
he
still
could
not
refer
to
tibbs
as
mister
tibbs
or
officer
tibbs
but
rather
settled
for
virgil
.
instead
,
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
eventually
going
to
see
the
world
differently
in
the
future
.
most
movies
would
have
a
character
reversing
all
of
his
beliefs
and
influences
in
a
matter
of
minutes
.
this
action
would
not
have
been
realistic
at
all
since
it
is
nearly
impossible
for
someone
to
believe
something
one
day
and
believe
something
else
the
next
day
.
jewison
'
s
determination
to
make
this
film
as
realistic
as
possible
is
very
obvious
here
and
also
very
appropriate
.
"
in
the
heat
of
the
night
"
shows
the
difference
between
the
north
and
the
south
or
a
major
city
and
a
small
town
in
the
united
states
during
the
1960
'
s
.
it
displays
this
perfectly
.
however
,
the
actual
investigation
,
although
it
is
not
the
main
focus
of
the
film
,
lacks
interest
.
it
seemed
rushed
especially
towards
the
end
as
if
jewison
had
given
his
message
about
racism
and
did
not
feel
like
giving
a
credible
explanation
involving
the
murder
victim
.
there
were
way
too
many
characters
added
during
the
last
fifteen
minutes
and
some
of
the
scenes
during
this
time
period
were
inane
(
police
officer
sam
being
a
suspect
was
not
needed
)
.
also
,
it
is
given
that
tibbs
is
a
vigilant
homicide
detective
who
is
the
best
at
what
he
does
,
but
some
of
his
discoveries
came
out
of
nowhere
and
how
he
found
out
some
of
the
important
case
details
towards
the
end
were
never
answered
.
the
rushed
ending
was
the
only
mistake
of
this
otherwise
memorable
jewison
classic
.
(
a
congratulations
has
to
be
given
to
actor
scott
wilson
.
he
managed
to
be
in
the
two
best
movies
of
1967
,
"
in
the
heat
of
the
night
"
and
the
even
better
"
in
cold
blood

in
wonder

michael
douglas
plays
an
aged
writer
\
professor
with
such
lived
-
in
naturalism
that
i
believe
it
may
be
his
best
performance
.
ever
since
wall
street
,
douglas
has
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
career
playing
variations
on
the
shark
in
a
suit
gordon
gecko
character
he
personified
in
the
mid
-
80
'
s
.
in
those
performances
he
tended
to
exaggerate
the
vehemence
of
cutthroat
businessmen
,
with
much
frothing
at
the
mouth
while
projecting
all
his
bad
intentions
to
the
world
.
you
'
d
think
such
a
man
would
keep
his
evil
wrapped
tightly
underneath
a
good
-
natured
veneer
,
but
from
gordon
gecko
to
nicholas
van
orton
,
douglas
played
the
role
straight
and
out
in
the
open
.
in
wonder
boys
his
performance
isn
'
t
showy
or
a
tour
de
force
,
it
'
s
simple
yet
truthful
.
he
embodies
grady
,
a
craggy
old
writer
with
a
predilection
for
pot
and
pink
bathrobes
.
grady
instructs
a
writers
workshop
while
working
tirelessly
on
a
follow
up
to
the
novel
that
put
him
on
the
map
.
when
we
first
encounter
this
curmudgeon
in
the
midst
of
his
workshop
,
we
hear
his
sardonic
narration
on
the
soundtrack
as
students
bombard
one
of
their
own
with
unfair
criticisms
.
grady
points
out
,
in
his
narration
,
that
they
only
do
so
out
of
jealousy
.
their
target
is
the
very
writerly
named
james
leer
(
played
by
the
always
understated
tobey
maguire
)
,
a
student
full
of
potential
and
one
whom
grady
develops
a
mild
affection
for
.
leer
is
the
kind
of
youth
who
seems
to
mechanically
block
out
emotions
.
he
speaks
in
an
intellectualized
monotone
with
just
a
hint
of
dry
wit
around
the
edges
.
he
'
s
portentous
and
gloomy
,
as
if
modeling
himself
after
the
great
depressed
writers
,
though
his
act
is
a
little
too
calculated
.
he
reminds
me
of
the
self
-
imposed
outcast
film
director
,
jim
jarmusch
(
dead
man
,
ghost
dog
)
.
whenever
i
happen
to
catch
jarmusch
in
an
interview
i
see
the
man
speaking
in
a
toneless
manner
(
the
monotonous
drawl
supposedly
masking
depth
or
contempt
for
his
interviewer
)
,
exclusively
dressed
in
black
,
and
with
his
spiked
hair
dyed
snow
white
.
leer
is
similar
,
a
guy
who
equates
quirks
with
depth
.
tobey
maguire
fits
well
in
the
role
.
with
his
round
,
sweet
-
eerie
face
he
resembles
bud
cort
from
harold
and
maude
.
but
unlike
cort
,
maguire
is
easier
to
warm
up
to
;
he
'
s
a
messed
up
kid
reaching
for
artistic
credibility
.
katie
holmes
plays
hannah
,
a
beautiful
,
talented
writing
student
just
itching
to
get
in
grady

pants
.
this
is
a
plot
line
i
had
trouble
with
.
douglas
,
in
his
old
age
,
is
beginning
to
resemble
jerry
springer
,
a
man
who
has
actually
paid
for
sex
on
numerous
documented
occasions
.
at
first
i
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
believe
that
someone
as
beautiful
as
hannah
would
desire
grady
(
maybe
it
'
s
because
i
'
m
jealous
,
and
wish
holmes
was
throwing
herself
at
me
,
after
all
i
may
just
be
a
lowly
internet
critic
but
at
least
i
still
have
all
my
teeth
)
,
then
i
think
of
douglas
'
s
real
life
companion
,
the
breathtaking
catherine
zeta
jones
.
seeing
those
two
together
looks
a
lot
like
a
kidnapping
.
suddenly
my
mind
has
shifted
from
the
task
at
hand
(
that
being
reviewing
this
completely
wonderful
movie
)
and
i
'
m
pontificating
on
why
the
hell
jones
would
desire
douglas
.
there
is
a
movie
in
there
somewhere
.
grady
,
rather
chivalrously
if
you
ask
me
,
resists
the
charms
of
hannah
for
sara
gaskell
(
a
droll
frances
mcdormand
)
,
who
is
his
age
,
but
also
married
to
another
professor
.
okay
,
maybe
not
so
chivalrous
.
there
is
a
great
line
in
the
film
spoken
by
douglas
about
sara
where
he
says
,
"
she
was
a
junkie
for
the
printed
word
.
lucky
for
me
i
manufactured
her
drug
of

plays

editor

gleefully
dry

articulate
wit
of

intellectual

he
'

arrogant

completely
likeable
in
his
utter
arrogance

the
actor
is
perfectly
cast
here
,
and
remains
a
joyous
movie
presence
somewhere
between
a
typical
tom

comic
leading
man
and
edgy
character
actor
.
i
wish
wonder
boys
had
more
of
him

searching
for
a
plot
among
the
elements
of
wonder

would
be
pointless
,
for
it
meanders
through
its
running
time
,
but
that
'
s
part
of
its
charm
.
and
maybe
i
'
m
a
bit
biased
towards
the
film
because
it
takes
place
in
a
haven
of
literary
academia
,
a
place
i
'
m
greatly
fond
of
,
and
a
place
rarely
explored
in
american
cinema
.
everyone
has
a
sub
-
genre
(
be
it
war
films
,
westerns
,
dance
movies
)
that
they
happen
to
be
privy
to
.
i
'
m
privy
to
films
about
literary
types
i
.
e
.
those
individuals
enthralled
by
the
written
word
,
and
if
you
are
not
so
inclined
it
may
be
wise
to
knock
my
above
grade
down
about
half
a
notch
.
the
direction
by
curtis
hanson
is
more
akin
to
a
european
film
with
its
leisurely
pace
and
situations
that
grow
from
the
characters
,
rather
than
generic
mapped
out
story
points
.
sometimes
the
dialogue
is
too
clever
,
but
that
'
s
a
problem
i
wish
i
found
with
films
more
often
.
another
minor
quibble
is
that
early
on
the
film
seems
a
bit
too
introverted
,
like
its
characters
,
but
as
the
story
progresses
it
begins
to
open
up
.
for
me
wonder
boys
works
as
subtle
drama
because
of
its
insight
into
artistic
types
,
and
as
a
low
-
key
comedy
for
its
chuckle
-
worthy
throwaway
gags
.
the
gags
are
like
those
in
the
great
robert
altman
(
m
*
a
*
s
*
h
,
the
long
goodbye
)
movies
,
where
jokes
exist
as
asides
on
the
fringes
,
like
jokes
in
life
often
do
.
the
broader
comedy
such
as
the
killing
of
a
blind
dog
,
and
incessant
smoking
of
marijuana
isn
'
t
ineffective
but
not
nearly
as
memorable
as
the
little
things
.
curtis
hanson
,
who
before
his
last
film
,
la
confidential
,
toiled
about
with
exploitation
fare
like
losin
'
it
(
an
early
tom
cruise
sex
comedy
)
and
the
hand
the
rocks
the
cradle
,
has
graduated
to
more
meaningful
films
.
he
directs
wonder
boys
in
an
appropriately
dour
style
,
the
comedy
coming
from
the
false
gloom
his
characters
put
up
.
the
morose
crooning
of
leonard
cohen
would
seem
an
odd
song
for
the
background
of
any
party
,
but
in
a
wonder
boys
party
,
it
fits
.
the
film
is
like
a
piece
of
literature
put
up
on
the
big
screen
.
it
'
s
the
cinematic
equivalent
to
a
good
read
,
novelistic
in
its
approach
with
themes
rarely
found
in
american
movies

many
will
find
it
slight
,

i
found
much
to
savor

its
subtleties

don

idiotic

there

time

if

grant
them
the
"
stupid
"
,
but
consider
it
funny
instead
.
i
personally
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
,
cracked
up
loudly
during
a
couple
of
specific
sequences
and
loved
the
derek
zoolander
character
and
the
unrestrained
whipping
they
released
upon
the
fashion
industry
.
snap
!
it
was
also
nice
to
see
several
real
-
life
models
with
small
roles
in
the
movie
,
not
taking
themselves
too
seriously
.
and
if
you
'
re
the
type
of
person
who
likes
celebrity
cameos
in
films
,
well
,
don
'
t
look
any
further
because
dozens
of
famous
faces
show
up
here
including
vince
vaughn
,
billy
zane
,
winona
ryder
,
christian
slater
,
david
duchovny
,
natalie
portman
and
many
,
many
others
.
i
especially
liked
andy
dick
'
s
complete
make
-
over
as
the
masseuse
.
hi
-
larious
!
but
with
all
films
of
this
type
,
there
is
bound
to
be
some
stuff
that
simply
doesn
'
t
work
.
a
few
particulars
which
didn
'
t
strike
my
fancy
included
the
bulimia
and
"
orgy
"
sequence
with
christine
taylor
,
the
break
-
dance
fighting
,
and
i
also
never
get
why
they
use
real
countries
in
plots
like
this
(
why
not
just
"
make
up
"
a
country
,
instead
of
zeroing
in
on
a
certain
people
?
)
.
i
also
could
have
done
with
less
of
the
taylor
character
in
general
,
since
she
wasn
'
t
all
that
interesting
and
seemed
to
slow
things
down
every
now
and
then
(
more
zoolander
,
dude
!
)
.
but
those
few
missteps
were
nothing
compared
to
some
of
the
more
memorable
scenes
which
definitely
did
work
for
me
!
i
almost
pissed
myself
during
the
"
gas
station
"
disaster
,
absolutely
adored
the
"
walk
-
off
"
contest
(
with
david
bowie
as
the
judge
,
no
less
)
and
appreciated
many
of
zoolander
'
s
moronic
one
-
liners
(
"
i
was
a
merman
.
.
.
a

"
)
.
and
i
dare
you
to
get
his
"
monkey
"
photo
shoot
out
of
your
head
after
seeing
this
movie
(
"
you
'
re
a
monkey
,
derek
.
.
.
a
monkey
!
"
)
i
also
really
liked
the
soundtrack
and
the
pace
of
the
film
,
both
of
which
zipped
and
zagged
,
and
established
a
nice
rhythm
to
it
all
.
again
,
it
'
s
to
note
that
this
movie
is
dumb
and
not
for
everyone
,
but
my
guess
is
that
if
you
laughed
at
the
trailer
,
you
will
likely
enjoy
many
of
the
quips
in
the
actual
picture
as
well
.
if
you
thought
the
trailer
was
dumb
,
skip
this
dodo

and
go
rent

something

obvious

unzipped
is
a
cinematic
portrait
of
isaac
mizrahi
,
an
artist
whose
palette
is
fabric
.
ostensibly
,
the
film
is
a
documentary
,
but
use
of
that
term
requires
stretching
its
meaning
.
many
scenes
appear
staged
,
and
a
great
deal
of
cutting
-
and
-
pasting
has
been
done
in
the
editing
room
.
the
cinema
verite
effect
is
a
conceit
--
genuine
spontaneity
is
at
a
premium
,
and
everyone
is
aware
of
and
playing
to
the
camera
(
especially
would
-
be
actresses
like
cindy
crawford
)
.
director
douglas
keeve
(
who
was
mizrahi
'
s
lover
at
the
time
)
freely
admits
that
he
"
couldn
'
t
care
less
about
the
truth
"
but
was
more
interested
in
capturing
"
the
spirit
and
love
in
isaac
and
in
fashion
.
"
despite
violating
nearly
every
rule
of
"
legitimate
"
documentary
film
making
,
however
,
unzipped
is
a
remarkably
enjoyable
piece
of
entertainment
.
while
it
sheds
only
a
little
light
on
the
behind
-
the
-
scenes
world
of
the
fashion
industry
,
it
presents
a
fascinating
,
if
incomplete
,
picture
of
designer
mizrahi
.
this
man
is
the
perfect
subject
for
this
kind
of
study
--
he
'
s
funny
,
energetic
,
and
eminently
quotable
.
he
has
unusual
views
on
just
about
everything
,
from
fashion
(
"
it
'
s
about
women
not
wanting
to
look
like
cows
"
)
to
mary
tyler
moore
(
"
between
her
and
jackie
kennedy
,
they
shaped
this
country
"
)
to
style
(
"
it
'
s
almost
impossible
to
have
style
nowadays
without
the
right
dogs
"
)
.
unzipped
also
gives
a
glimpse
into
the
creative
process
by
which
mizrahi
turns
an
idea
into
a
dress
.
it
'
s
almost
certainly
different
that
anyone
would
imagine
.
the
designer
draws
on
a
variety
of
sources
for
his
look
,
including
nanook
of
the
north
and
old
bette
davis
movies
,
then
enlists
the
aid
of
a
ouija
board
to
help
form
the
collection
.
in
particular
,
unzipped
traces
mizrahi
'
s
development
of
his
fall
1994
line
from
its
inception
in
the
spring
to
the
final
fashion
show
,
which
highlights
a
number
of
prominent
models
,
including
cindy
crawford
,
naomi
campbell
,
kate
bush
,
and
linda
evangelista
.
on
the
technical
side
,
a
number
of
interesting
choices
were
made
in
filming
unzipped
.
a
variety
of
film
stocks
were
used
:
super
8
,
16
mm
black
-
and
-
white
,
and
35
mm
color
.
there
is
a
purpose
to
this
beyond
simple
artiness
--
the
stock
often
serves
as
an
emotional
key
to
the
movie
,
and
,
during
the
climactic
fashion
show
,
color
is
used
to
show
the
audience
'
s
perspective
,
while
black
-
and
-
white
is
for
the
behind
-
the
-
scenes
sequences
.
nevertheless
,
some
viewers
will
be
put
off
by
this
treatment
.
while
unzipped
isn
'
t
an
expose
on
the
fashion
industry
per
se
,
keeve
has
enough
clips
of
petulant
models
to
make
the
viewer
realize
how
tame
robert
altman
was
with
ready
to
wear
.
overall
,
however
,
this
movie
is
far
more
about
mizrahi
than
anything
else
,
and
only
when
viewed
from
that
perspective
does
unzipped
succeed
.
when
the
designer
declares
that
"
everything
is
frustrating
except
designing
clothes
--
that
'
s
beautiful
and
liberating
,
"
it
fits
perfectly
with
the
image
of
him
that
unzipped
has
constructed
.
dora
(
fernanda
montenegro
)
sits
behind
a
make
-
shift
desk
at
rio
+
s
major
train
station
.
she
,
in
her
colorful
demeanor
,
offers
a
service
that
is
unheard
of
in
the
states
.
she
writes
letters
for
the
illiterate
,
who
pass
through
,
to
try
to
find
lost
relatives
,
find
love
,
or
search
after
lost
debts
.
she
+
s
quirky
,
she
+
s
elderly
,
she
+
s
caring
.
totally
trustworthy
,
right
?
not
a
chance
.
once
home
,
she
never
sends
these
letters
,
saving
money
on
postage
,
and
relishing
in
the
drama
contained
therein
with
her
neighbor
irene
(
mar
?
lia
p
?
ra
)
.
one
of
the
letters
is
sent
by
a
young
mother
with
her
nine
-
year
old
son
,
looking
for
their
father
.
shortly
thereafter
,
she
gets
hit
by
a
bus
,
and
the
son
is
orphaned
.
days
go
by
,
and
the
boy
,
named
josu
?
,
roams
around
the
station
,
hungry
,
desperate
,
and
somewhat
clueless
to
his
predictament
.
through
a
series
of
circumstances
too
precious
to
elaborate
upon
,
dora
somehow
takes
a
responsibility
in
trying
to
find
josu
?
+
s
father
.
this
means
leaving
the
security
of
rio
,
traveling
to
the
outskirts
of
brazil
,
where
unpaved
roads
,
religious
devotees
and
the
poverty
-
stricken
become
commonplace
.
films
like
this
remind
me
as
to
what
i
enjoy
about
some
foreign
films
.
it
is
an
opportunity
for
me
to
get
a
fresh
breath
in
another
part
of
the
world
,
so
distant
from
my
own
.
it
does
so
entertainingly
,
and
so
heart
-
wrenchingly
.
and
yet
,
it
+
s
backdrop
is
merely
that
.
the
focus
is
on
the
minute
transformation
of
dora
,
of
how
she
learns
to
love
this
little
kid
,
without
being
cloying
or
sentimental
.
the
most
interesting
backdrop
is
the
amount
of
religious
dedication
is
in
the
film
.
dora
being
an
amoral
scam
-
artist
,
could
care
less
about
the
amount
of
bickering
between
the
candle
-
lighting
of
the
catholics
versus
the
bumper
-
sticker
mentality
of
the
evangelicals
.
but
neither
side
is
trivialized
.
she
even
begins
to
develop
an
affection
for
a
non
-
drinking
evangelical
,
who
sees
the
problems
with
dora
,
if
not
initially
.
fernanda
montenegro
surprisingly
got
an
oscar
nomination
for
this
very
delicate
performance
,
but
the
true
marvel
is
that
of
vinicius
de
oliveira
,
who
plays
josu
?
.
he

of

mie

_la

)
and
giorgio
cantarini
(
_life

)
,
prove
that
the
true
acting
discoveries
may
be
outside
of
the
united
states
.
he
is

natural
,
and
never

grating
.
send
a
memo
to
jonathan
taylor
thomas
.
the
event
of
events
is
upon
us
.
people
have
waited
twenty
-
two
years
for
the
prequel
to
star
wars
and
die
-
hard
fans
have
been
camping
out
at
theaters
for
months
to
get
tickets
to
see
it
.
i
don
'
t
think
that
america
will
ever
actually
recover
from
what
this
hurricane
of
a
film
has
caused
.
it
is
not
a
bit
of
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
this
is
the
most
highly
anticipated
movie
in
history
.
anyone
who
tells
you
"
it
'
s
just
a
movie
"
is
either
lying
or
clueless
.
it
is
clearly
obvious
that
after
the
waiting
and
the
hype
actually
seeing
the
movie
will
be
anticlimactic
.
the
second
coming
of
the
lord
could
not
live
up
to
the
kind
of
buzz
(
which
is
far
too
weak
a
word
)
that
star
wars
epsode
i
:
the
phantom
menace
so
effortlessly
generated
.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
film
itself
is
bad
.
in
fact
,
it
is
terrific
.
i
strongly
suspect
that
many
of
the
people
who
were
dissappointed
by
it
have
simply
surrendered
to
the
media
machine
and
the
inevitable
backlash
.
it
is
set
some
decades
before
the
events
of
the
original
1977
star
wars
took
place
.
the
film
focuses
on
the
fledgling
republic
of
planets
and
the
conflict
that
is
raging
:
the
trade
federation
,
angry
at
some
tax
raise
that
was
recently
put
in
place
has
invaded
the
small
,
peaceful
planet
of
naboo
.
the
republic
sent
two
jedi
knights
(
people
that
can
actively
communicate
with
what
is
affectionately
known
as
"
the
force
"
)
,
qui
-
gon
jinn
(
liam
neeson
)
and
obi
-
wan
kenobi
(
ewan
mcgregor
)
to
negotiate
.
unable
to
stop
the
tide
of
events
that
was
about
to
occur
,
the
jedi
and
the
queen
of
naboo
(
natalie
portman
)
escape
naboo
and
head
for
coruscant
to
try
and
get
the
republic
senate
to
intervene
.
on
the
way
they
get
sidetracked
to
a
planet
called
tatooine
,
where
they
meet
the
movie
'
s
real
focal
point
,
young
anakin
skywalker
(
jake
lloyd
)
.
he
is
an
innocent
slave
boy
,
but
"
the
force
is
strong
with
him
"
so
qui
-
gon
is
determined
to
take
him
with
them
to
the
jedi
counsel
and
get
him
trained
as
a
jedi
.
as
any
self
-
respecting
star
wars
fan
should
know
,
anakin
will
grow
up
to
be
darth
vader
and
give
birth
to
luke
skywalker
.
>
from
the
beginning
it
is
evident
that
this
is
not
an
actor
'
s
movie
.
around
70
%
of
the
characters
,
if
not
more
,
are
computer
generated
in
one
form
or
another
,
and
though
the
effects
are
seamless
,
the
movie
lacks
soul
.
i
think
that
although
the
computer
has
played
an
incredibly
instrumental
part
in
moviemaking
this
decade
,
cinema
should
still
be
a
human
art
and
the
phantom
menace
nearly
defies
this
.
this
is
the
lightest
installment
in
the
star
wars
saga
thus
far
,
with
plenty
of
broad
comic
relief
to
go
around
,
much
of
it
courtesy
of
an
irritating
knew
character
named
jar
-
jar
binks
.
he
'
s
essentially
a
computer
-
animated
sidekick
who
says
things
like
"
exqueeze
me
?
"
and
"
mesa
go
now
,
okeday
?
"
,
and
although
it
is
often
amusing
it
is
also
inherently
annoying
.
the
visual
effects
are
astounding
(
although
director
george
lucas
often
chickens
out
by
cutting
away
from
them
)
and
the
movie
is
a
thrilling
triumph
.
if
it
lacks
in
plot
and
in
acting
it
makes
up
for
it
through
imagination
and
excitement
.
the
climactic
lightsaber
battle
(
oh
,
come
on
,
as
if
you
didn
'
t
already
know
)
,
among
other
things
,
is
outrageously
entertaining
and
defines
the
term
"
popcorn
movie
"
.
what
made
me
surrender
and
give
this
movie
*
*
*
1
/
2
stars
was
the
score
by
john
williams
.
even
though
it
does
seem
like
the
man
scores
every
single
movie
that
comes
out
these
days
,
his
work
here
is
nothing
short
of
brilliant
.
his
use
of
opera
during
the
climax
really
does
add
a
punch
and
his
ingenious
way
of
utilizing
the
imperial
march
as
a
sort
of
prophecy
is
chilling
.
the
phantom
menace
is
probably
most
effective
as
pop
nostalgia
.
when
you
see
"
a
long
time
ago
,
in
a
galaxy
far
,
far
away
"
,
when
the
familiar
music
plays
,
when
the
words
"
star
wars
"
appear
on
screen
,
you
'
ll
feel
a
tingle
even
if
you
didn
'
t
see
the
movie
when
it
first
came
out
in
'
77
.
it
feels
oddly
exciting
to
be
introduced
to
young
anakin
,
a
boy
whose
innocence
,
we
know
,
will
be
taken
away
and
who
will
soon
cross
over
to
the
dark
side
.
it
is
the
perfect
example
of
dramatic
irony
to
see
the
jedi
masters
aspire
to
get
him
trained
in
the
jedi
arts
;
we
know
that
it
will
do
more
harm
than
good
,
but
they
do
not
.
we
not
only
feel
more
involved
in
the
story
,
but
we
feel
like
we
'
re
seeing
the
beginning
of
a
saga
that
we
have
cherished
for
years
.
the
phantom
menace
,
although
lacking
in
human
aspects
of
the
story
,
is
a
very
worthy
installment
in
the
star
wars
.
it
works
as
an
action
flick

sometimes
a

comes
along
that
falls
somewhat
askew
of
the
rest

some
people
call
it
"
original

some

simply
call

a

to
bring
about

whew
!
anyone
in
their
30
'
s
or
above
is
probably
not
going
to
grasp
what
can
be
enjoyed
about
this
film
.
it
'
s
somewhat
silly
,
it
'
s
somewhat
outrageous
,
and
it
'
s
definitely
not
your
typical
romance
story
,
but
for
the
right
audience
,
it
works
.
a
lot
of
hype
has
been
surrounding
this
film
due
to
the
fact
that
it
comes
to
us
from
the
same
team
that
brought
us
trainspotting
.
well
sorry
folks
,
but
i
haven
'
t
seen
trainspotting
so
i
can
'
t
really
compare
.
whether
that
works
in
this
film
'
s
favor
or
not
is
beyond
me
.
but
i
do
know
this
:
ewan
mcgregor
,
whom
i
had
never
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
,
definitely
charmed
me
.
he
was
great
!
cameron
diaz
'
s
character
was
uneven
and
a
bit
hard
to
grasp
.
the
audience
may
find
it
difficult
to
care
about
her
,
thus
discouraging
the
hopes
of
seeing
her
unite
with
mcgregor
after
we
are
immediately
sucked
into
caring
about
and
identifying
with
him
.
misguided
?
you
bet
.
loveable
?
you
bet
.
a
life
less
ordinary
was
a
delight
and
even
had
a
bonus
for
me
when
i
realized
it
was
filmed
in
my
hometown
of
salt
lake
city
,
utah
.
this
was
just
one
more
thing
i
didn
'
t
know
about
this
movie
when
i
sat
down
with
a
five
dollar
order
of
nachos
and
a
three
dollar
coke
.
maybe
not
knowing
the
premise
behind
this
film
made
for
a
pleasant
surprise
,
but
i
think
even
if
i
had
known
,
i
would
have
been
just
as
happy
.
a
life
less
ordinary
is
quirky
,
eccentric
,
and
downright
charming
!
not
for
everyone
,
but
a
definite
change
of
pace
for
your
typical
night
at
the
movies
.
that
thing
you
do
!
(
r
)
tom
hanks
'
s
screenwriting
and
directorial
debut
,
that
thing
you
do
!
,
has
all
the
qualities
you
would
associate
with
the
most
beloved
screen
actor
of
the
moment
:
fun
,
lively
,
and
oh
-
so
-
nice
.
it
is
the
latter
quality
,
however
,
that
becomes
a
hindrance
,
for
this
'
60s
nostalgia
trifle
is
so
nice
and
sweet
that
it
teeters
on
becoming
bland
milquetoast
.
that
thing
focuses
on
the
wonders
,
a
teen
rock
band
from
erie
,
pennsylvania
that
is
suddenly
thrust
into
the
national
spotlight
in
1964
when
they
score
a
major
dance
hit
called
,
of
course
,
"
that
thing
you
do
!
"
the
group
'
s
members
are
,
naturally
a
diverse
group
:
there
'
s
brooding
lead
singer
and
songwriter
jimmy
(
johnathon
schaech
)
;
girl
-
crazy
lenny
(
steve
zahn
)
,
the
lead
guitarist
;
a
goofy
,
geeky
type
known
only
as
the
bass
player
(
ethan
embry
)
;
and
the
film
'
s
center
,
guy
(
tom
everett
scott
)
,
the
drummer
who
has
aspirations
in
jazz
.
along
for
the
wonders
'
ride
to
success
is
jimmy
'
s
perpetually
neglected
galpal
,
faye
(
liv
tyler
)
.
hanks
proves
to
be
a
capable
writer
-
director
,
deftly
recreating
the
innocent
spirit
of
1964
,
which
hanks
calls
"
the
last
innocent
year
.
"
the
spirit
is
not
only
reflected
in
the
period
clothes
and
settings
but
also
in
the
music
,
which
,
like
the
other
recent
period
music
film
,
grace
of
my
heart
,
was
expressly
written
for
the
film
;
hanks
himself
had
a
hand
in
writing
four
of
the
tunes
--
but
not
the
infectious
title
cut
by
adam
schlesinger
,
which
is
guaranteed
to
stay
in
your
head
long
after
the
end
credits
have
rolled
(
it
'
s
still
playing
in
my
mind
as
i
write
this
)
.
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
hanks
the
director
works
well
with
the
actors
,
eliciting
charming
,
likable
work
from
the
entire
cast
,
most
notably
hanks
lookalike
scott
and
tyler
,
who
is
remarkable
in
delivering
the
film
'
s
biggest
and
best
dramatic
moment
.
the
work
of
the
young
ensemble
is
so
natural
that
they
truly
convince
as
teens
of
the
early
'
60s
;
they
do
not
appear
to
be
'
90s
grungers
playacting
"
retro
.
"
yet
for
all
the
light
,
frothy
charms
of
that
thing
you
do
!
,
it
'
s
nearly
nice
to
a
fault
.
while
this
unbridled
innocence
in
film
is
a
refreshing
change
from
all
the
sinful
cinema
around
these
days
,
there
is
not
enough
conflict
to
keep
things
consistently
interesting
.
everyone
is
so
happy
,
basking
in
the
glow
of
overnight
success
,
marvelling
at
it
all
--
except
toward
the
end
,
but
even
then
the
tone
quickly
reverts
to
sweetness
,
ending
on
an
appropriately
feel
-
good
note
.
there
isn
'
t
much
of
an
edge
throughout
that
thing
--
the
only
thing
that
is
remotely
edgy
is
hanks
'
s
turn
as
the
wonders
'
manager
--
and
thus
becomes
in
danger
of
being
so
nice
it
'
s
bland
.
but
a
little
niceness
goes
a
long
way
these
days
,
and
there
'
s
no
denying
the
entertainment
value
of
that
thing
you
do
!
;
it
'
s
just
about
impossible
to
hate
.
it
'
s
an
inoffensive
,
enjoyable
piece
of
nostalgia
that
is
sure
to
leave
audiences
smiling
and
humming
,
if
not
singing
,
"
that
thing
you
do
!
"
--
quite
possibly
for
days
.
to
paraphrase
a
passage
from
the
song
:
though
i
try
and
try
to
forget
that
song
it
is
just
so
hard
to
do
every
time
they
play
"
that
thing
you
do
!
"
"
he
'
s
back
,
and
it
'
s
about
time
.
"
was
the
motto
for
this
television
series
pilot
(
i
call
it
a
pilot
,
i
don
'
t
care
what
fox
network
says
)
revival
of
the
cult
classic
british
tv
show
,
doctor
who
,
that
spawned
no
series
,
which
means
there
are
no
smart
network
execs
out
there
(
not
exactly
news
to
a
lot
of
people
,
i
know
)
.
the
motto
was
well
chosen
.
the
series
was
simple
,
it
was
about
this
time
lord
scientist
called
the
doctor
with
thirteen
lives
who
traveled
around
in
a
type
forty
spaceship
called
a
tardis
outsmarting
all
kind
of
alien
baddies
,
including
the
evil
daleks
,
and
the
master
,
who
appears
in
this
feature
,
played
very
badly
by
eric
roberts
.
as
good
as
this
revival
was
,
there
is
something
missing
from
it
to
make
sure
it
was
really
doctor
who
.
is
it
the
acting
?
hell
,
no
!
paul
mcgann
is
just
as
good
as
any
of
the
other
seven
guys
who
'
ve
played
the
doctor
(
including
his
predecessor
and
off
-
screen
friend
sylvester
mccoy
,
who
appears
once
more
for
the
regeneration
scene
)
.
he
looks
right
for
the
role
,
is
a
brilliant
actor
,
and
slips
effortlessly
into
the
role
,
the
way
my
two
favorites
jon
pertwee
and
tom
baker
would
.
daphne
ashbrook
brings
class
to
her
role
as
dr
.
grace
holloway
,
the
doctor
'
s
first
companion
that
he
kisses
on
screen
,
she
is
not
your
typical
female
companion
who
screams
,
and
spends
her
free
time
making
coffee
for
the
doctor
,
she
is
a
tough
,
spunky
american
,
and
ashbrook
shows
this
well
.
young
yee
jee
tso
shows
promise
as
chang
lee
,
and
i
'
ve
seen
him
in
other
stuff
in
which
he
usually
plays
the
punk
kid
who
dies
at
the
end
(
this
film
included
)
,
which
,
imho
,
wastes
his
talent
.
the
only
problem
with
the
acting
is
eric
roberts
.
one
time
he
had
to
say
to
mcgann
'
s
doctor
,
"
i
always
dress
for
the
occasion
.
"
but
he
broke
it
up
,
and
said
it
so
slowly
that
it
wounded
up
sounding
like
a
song
lyric
,
"
i
always
.
.
.
dress
.
.
.
for
the
occasion
.
"
you
need
an
actor
less
slow
and
less
reliant
on
moving
his
hands
to
act
,
and
who
'
s
also
british
,
like
mcgann
is
as
the
doctor
.
executive
producer
phil
segal
said
he
was
casted
because
fox
insisted
on
having
one
american
star
in
the
role
.
i
dunno
who
thought
of
casting
him
,
but
if
they
'
re
reading
this
:
news
flash
:
eric
roberts
is
*
not
*
a
star
!
he
rides
on
his
sister
'
s
coattails
,
and
any
hit
movie
he
makes
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
is
this
problem
the
kisses
to
the
past
?
they
have
references
to
the
show
so
subtle
that
non
fans
would
not
notice
them
,
only
whovians
would
,
and
they
'
re
good
.
is
it
the
script
or
the
movie
as
a
whole
?
the
script
is
a
classy
piece
of
work
,
featuring
a
master
who
can
spit
slime
out
of
his
mouth
and
nice
dialogue
,
and
the
movie
as
a
whole
is
one
fans
will
love
,
and
it
is
a
good
stand
alone
viewing
for
nonfans
to
enjoy
the
series
.
so
what
is
it
?
simple
:
no
plot
.
the
master
,
on
his
last
legs
,
sends
for
the
doctor
to
rescue
him
after
the
daleks
put
him
on
trial
on
their
planet
skaro
and
exterminate
him
.
the
doctor
attempts
to
take
his
remains
back
to
gallifrey
,
but
they
accidentally
land
in
san
francisco
,
1999
,
december

,
where
the
master
,
with
young
street
hood
chang
lee
'
s
help
,
opens
the
eye
of
harmony
,
which
will
suck
the
earth
through
it
at
midnight
if
the
doctor
,
with
the
help
of
female
surgeon
,
dr
.
grace
holloway
,
doesn
'
t
close
it
by
then
.
virtually
no
plot
.
i
was
told
the
movie
would
'
ve
featured
the
daleks
on
screen
and
started
with
more
of
a
courtroom
drama
between
the
master
and
the
daleks
,
but
a
lot
of
rewriting
went
on
on
the
set
.
that
shows
how
smart
people
are
,
as
it
would
have
made
the
movie
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
interesting
,
and
that
would

"
with
that
piece
of

,
we
are
fully
introduced
to
lester
burnham
(
kevin
spacey
)
,
a
42
year
old
man
trapped
within
his
own
life
.
lester
works
for
an
advertising
agency
.
his
growing
dissatisfaction
with
his
job
is
only
one
of
the
mid
-
life
crisis
he
is
suffering
.
estranged
from
both
his
wife
and
his
daughter
,
lester
starts
to
crack
under
the
stress
.
his
life
becomes
nothing
more
than
a
series
of
mastubatory
fantasies
,
and
sullen
apathy
.
carolyn
burnham
(
annette
bening
)
,
is
the
prototypical
career
woman
/
homemaker
.
she
carefully
tends
her
rose
garden
,
decorates
her
home
with
the
best
furnishings
.
but
inside
she
is
desperate
.
unsuccessful
at
her
profession
as
a
real
estate
agent
,
she
drives
herself
into
states
of
denial
and
self
loathing
that
only
feed
her
growing
resentment
towards
her
family
.
the
third
member
of
this
anti
-
family
is
jane
burnham
(
thora
birch
)
,
lester
and
carolyn
'
s
daughter
.
a
young
girl
going
through
the
typical
stages
of
adolescence
,
but
having
to
also
come
to
terms
with
her
families
growing
dysfunction
.
this
funny
(
and
frightening
)
slice
of
life
is
refreshingly
simple
.
not
one
character
is
given
less
than
is
needed
to
identify
him
or
her
.
some
of
the
most
telling
characters
are
those
that
serve
to
highlight
other
characters
.
most
notably
is
barbara
fitts
(
allison
janney
)
,
the
almost
catatonic
wife
of
retired
marine
colonel
fitts
.
she
has
almost
no
dialogue
,
and
seems
to
be
either
recovering
from
a
stroke
or
suffering
from
one
.
colonel
fitts
(
chris
cooper
)
is
an
angry
and
frightened
man
.
his
rage
directed
almost
singularly
at
his
son
,
ricky
(
wes
bentley
)
who
has
just
moved
with
his
family
to
the
same
neighborhood
as
the
burnham
'
s
.
in
fact
they
are
the
next
door
neighbors
.
anymore
detail
into
the
personalities
of
these
marvelously
diverse
characters
would
deprive
one
of
the
many
pleasures
and
surprises
to
be
had
in
"
american
beauty
"
.
alan
ball
,
who
was
the
co
-
executive
producer
of
the
hit
tv
series
"
cybil
"
and
creator
of
the
new
sitcom
"
oh
grow
up
"
,
has
fashioned
one
of
the
most
insightful
and
expertly
tuned
screenplays
to
have
hit
the
screen
in
the
past
ten
years
.
not
one
character
in
this
film
rings
falsely
.
and
the
depth
of
personality
in
each
,
is
achingly
honest
and
insightful
.
the
plot
detailing
the
last
year
in
the
life
of
a
man
as
he
tries
to
find
his
own
self
worth
is
so
resoundingly
cliched
and
at
the
same
time
original
as
to
bring
to
mind
such
marvelous
film
work
as
"
the
graduate
"
or
"
lolita
"
.
kevin
spacey
turns
in
one
of
this
years
most
pragmatic
performances
.
his
lester
burnham
is
an
everyman
caught
up
in
the
middle
of
a
life
that
is
spiraling
into
old
age
.
finally
unable
to
deal
with
the
lost
soul
that
he
has
become
,
lester
tries
to
return
to
his
youth
.
he
quits
his
job
(
actually
blackmailing
his
employer
for
one
year
'
s
salary
)
,
starts
smoking
pot
,
fantasizes
about
his
daughter
'
s
girlfriend
angela
(
mena
suvari
,
in
a
marvelous
performance
here
)
,
starts
working
out
,
and
finally
takes
a
job
at
the
local
fast
food
outlet
.
mr
.
spacey
'
s
performance
is
so
remarkably
subtle
and
ingenuous
,

on

favor

for
the

attacks

but
unlike
the
other
shrinks
,
sean
knows
what
he
is
in
for
and
continues
the
sessions
.
like
a
foster
mother
with
a
fussy
child
,
sean
knows
that
the
attacks
are
defensive
and
is
able
to
take
them
in
stride
.
like
the
foster
mother
,
sean
knows
that
time
and
quiet
patience
is
the
only
approach
.
robin
williams
is
excellent
in
this
role
.
he
'
s
not
an
actor
with
a
great
range
,
but
in
the
right
roles
he
has
great
depth
.
in
this
movie
,
as
in
awakenings
,
there
comes
a
point
when
the
quiet
,
shy
man
accomplishes
something
of
great
personal
importance
,
and
a
smile
of
pure
joy
spreads
up
to
his
eyes
.
williams
is
the
only
actor
i
can
name
who
can
make
an
audience
cry
just
by
smiling
.
i
have
compared
will
to
a
foster
child
and
that
'
s
not
entirely
fair
.
emotionally
,
he
has
a
lot
to
learn
,
but
he
is
not
a
child
.
he
has
thought
about
his
life
and
made
rational
decisions
about
what
he
wants
.
sean
,
his
girlfriend
,
his
pals
,
and
lambeau
all
help
him
grow
,
but
he
didn
'
t
start
out
asking
for
,
or
particularly
needing
,
help
.
his
exceptional
gift
singled
him
out
,
and
those
who
love
him
kept
pushing
him
in
the
right
direction
.
if
i
had
to
say
anything
bad
about
good
will
hunting
is
that
it
walks
the
line
between
drama
and
melodrama
.
it
'
s
too
sentimental
and
uplifiting
for
a
straight
drama
,
but
the
emotions
are
too
subtle
for
melodrama
.
it
is
emotionally
engaging
,
but
it
'
s
not
quite
larger
than
life
.
this
isn
'
t
a
problem
per
se
,
but
at
times
i
didn
'
t
know
quite
how
to
take
it
.
but
this
is
a
relatively
small
complaint
about
a
very
good
movie
.
a
good
movie
allows
its
characters
to
learn
and
grow
.
it
doesn
'
t
just
happen
;
it
takes
a
good
script
,
good
acting
,
and
good
direction
.
good
will
hunting
has
all
three
.
if
you
are
at
all
inclined
to
see
it
,
by
all
means
,
go
.
if
there
'
s
one
thing
in
common
about
all
of
hollywood
'
s
major
studios
,
it
'
s
that
their
productions
are
moving
toward
mainstream
more
and
more
.
although
twentieth
century
fox
and
new
line
cinema
have
spawned
subsidiaries
which
specialize
in
independant
or
controversial
motion
pictures
(
fox
searchlight
and
fine
line
respectively
)
,
it
'
s
obvious
there
'
s
no
significant
movement
underway
to
promote
inventive
ideas
at
the
theater
.
so
when
a
movie
like
gary
ross
'
pleasantville
comes
along
,
wrapped
in
a
blanket
of
innovative
ideas
and
served
up
on
a
platter
of
fine
production
,
it
'
s
a
welcome
change
of
pace
for
all
who
frequent
the
cineplexes
.
although
the
atmosphere
and
buzz
about
the
movie
are
cheery
and
lighthearted
,
pleasantville
should
not
be
mistaken
for
a
no
-
thought
movie
.
quite
the
opposite
is
true
,
in
fact
,
as
director
ross
skillfully
brings
a
narrative
with
intense
and
intelligent
undertones
to
the
screen
.
the
story
,
both
about
the
joys
of
living
life
to
the
fullest
as
well
as
the
social
ills
of
segregation
,
captures
the
essence
of
statement
-
making
in
the
cinema
.
not
in
recent
memory
has
a
movie
carried
such
weight
of
theme
into
widescale
distribution
,
and
even
if
mass
audiences
fail
to
see
the
ingenuity
of
ross
'
work
,
it
is
still
a
testament
that
his
picture
was
considered
worthy
enough
.
kudos
to
both
he
and
his
production
staff
for
putting
together
this
fine
picture
.
it
stars
tobey
maguire
and
reese
witherspoon
as
two
nineties
teenagers
who
,
through
quite
a
bit
of
luck
,
find
themselves
zapped
into
a
fifties
sitcom
named
"
pleasantville
.
"
maguire
,
as
the
reserved
bud
parker
,
is
perfect
for
the
pseudo

world
;
but
the
rebellious
mary
sue
(
witherspoon
)
is
not
at
all
made
for
the
father

knows

best
times
.
it
'
s
not
long
before
she
sets
the
town
of
pleasantville
on
end
,
and
begins
to
teach
the
townspeople

in
a
quite
unlikely
way
-
what
life
is

really
*
like
.
soon
hues
of
color
creep
into
the
black
and
white
world
,
and
while
some
embrace
the
change
in
the
passion
of
realism
,
others
fear
the
strangeness

at

end
is
a
soda
shop
owner

turned

painter
named
mr

johnson
(
jeff

)
and
at

other
end
is
a
close

minded
mayor
(
j

t
.
walsh
)
and
his
chamber
of
commerce
;
but
the
two
sides
are
simply
fronts
for
a
clash
of
ideas
that
soon
involves
the
entire
town
.
fine
performances
are
turned
in
all
around
.
maguire
and
witherspoon
are
effective
as
the
leads
,
but
the
true
complements
go
out
to
jeff
daniels
and
j
.
t
.
walsh
(
in
his
latest
and
final
posthumous
performance
)
.
daniels
brings
an
atmosphere
of
awe
,
inspiration
,
and
hope
to
his
character
,
whereas
walsh
simply
drips
of
sinister
closemindedness
-
almost
to
the
point
where
you
can
sense
gene
hackman
'
s
envy
.
for
daniels
,
it
'
s
his
most
commendable
performance
of
the
last
three
years
-
or
more
-
and
for
walsh
,
it
'
s
a
complementary
exclamation
point
on
a
fine
career
.
also
of
lesser
note
is
the
supporting
role
by
joan
allen
,
and
in
viewing
the
entire
cast
works
well
together
from
start
to
finish
.
there
'

not
much
to
dislike
about
pleasantville

and
its

it

.
in
filming
the
well
of

sequence
,
the
producers
scoured
every
pet
shop
in
london
and
the
south
of
england
for
every
snake
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
.
hence
there
are
snakes
that
are
identifiable
from
many
different
geographical
areas

however
,
once
all
the
snakes
were
on
set
,
it
became
clear
that
there
were
not
nearly
enough
of
them
,
so
spielberg
had
several
hoses
cut
into
lengths
,
and
these
were
used
as
well

looking
closely
,
you
can
tell
which
are
the
real
snakes
and
which
are
not

hardly
notices
the

shot
on

while

shots
are
handled
so
efficiently
that
they
quickly
take
on
the
nuances
of
the
aforementioned
john
woo
films
,
although
the
action
isn
'
t
as
hyperkinetic
as
most
of
woo
'
s
films
are
.
the
action
scenes
are
handled
with
a
kind
of
flair
though
,
and
eventually
begin
to
take
on
a
life
of
their
own
(
beyond
the
hong
kong
films
that
they
are
obviously
patterned
after
)
.
the
make

good

half
of

just
adds

essays
his

,

by

fields

organizing

.
unfortunately
,
carl
bradshaw
is
given
the
least
to
do
and
his
character
as
the
crime

seems
ineffective
(
largely
because
his
underlings
seem
to
run
all
over
him
)
,
but
then
again
,
that
could
be
the
way
his
character
was
intended
to
be
portrayed

the
music
in

pretty
decent

carries
on
the
theme
of
the
movie
established
early
on
by
the
quote
that
opens
this
review
.
oddly
enough
,
desmond
ballentine
(
who
plays
the
character
deportee
)
is
well
known
as
a
pioneer
in
the
realm
of

'
reggae
as
the
performer
ninjaman
,
and
he
doesn

t
contribute
a
single
song
to
the
film
(
that
i
could
see
)
,
which
is
virtually
unheard
of
here
in
the
us

at
the
time
of
this
writing
,
third
world
cop
has
been
put
into
limited
theatrical
release
in
the
us
,
coming
off
of
a
six
-
month
box
-
office
breaking
run
in
jamaica
,
where
it
holds
the
position
as
highest
grossing
film
of
all
time
(
bringing
in
$
21
million
in
jamaica
,
which
is
roughly
$
500

)
.
palm
pictures
(
the
company
that
released
the
offbeat
,
but
entertaining
six
-
string
samurai
)
is
the
company
releasing
the
film
and
considering
that
their
main
focus
is
the
dvd
market
,
i
can
imagine
that
a
disc
will
be
available
once
the
film
has
left
theaters
.
chris
blackwell
,

of

pictures
,
was
also
involved
in
the
production
of
another
jamaican
box
-
office
smash
in
1981
entitled
countryman
,
so
i
'
d
say
he
has
a
pretty
good
track
record
.
overall
,
third
world
cop
is
a
pretty
entertaining
homage
to
the
films
of
john
woo
,
ringo
lam
,
tsui
hark
,
and
many
other
action
films
by
directors
from
hong
kong
.
if
action
films
are
your
thing
and
you
don
'
t
mind
intermittent
subtitles
,
then
you
can
'
t
go
wrong
with
this
film
.
the
performances
and
the
story
are
solid
(
if
only
a
little
cliched
)
and
the
action
is
tight
.
i
'
m
not
sure
what
the
other
jamaican
films
released
in
that
country
are
like
,
but
apparently
third
world
cop
'
s
honors
are
well
deserved
.
at
first
glance
,
it
appears
that
the
home
alone

are
brainless
slapstick
intended
for
those
with
minds
of
8
-
year
olds

and
i
'
d
bet
money
that
it
'
s
true
of

(
opening
soon
)
.
but
home
alone
actually
has
a
lot
going
for
it
,
and
the
cartoon
slapstick
doesn
'
t
get
in
the
way
.
the
mcalisters
,
all
15
of
them
,
are
going
to
france
for
the
holidays
.
four
adults
and
eleven
kids
are
spending
the
night
together
before
heading
to
the
airport
en
masse
.
the
littlest
kid
,
kevin
,
is
the
victim
of
the
older
kids
'
cruelty
.
kevin
'
s
patience
runs
out
when
he
learns
that
his
plain
-
cheese
pizza
has
already
been
eaten
,
and
he
'
s
going
to
have
to
starve
.
he
attacks
his
big
bully
brother
buzz
,
who
had
been
teasing
him
.
the
fight
disrupts
the
already
-
chaotic
dinner
,
spilling
milk
and
soft
drinks
all
over
the
table
,
a
few
cousins
,
and
an
uncle
.
the
knee
-
jerk
reaction
is
for
everyone
to
blame
kevin
.
nobody
came
to
his
rescue
when
he
was
being
teased
,
but
they
all
point
their
fingers
when
he
fights
back
.
the
ultimate
punishment
comes
from
mom
(
catherine
o
'
hara
)
who
sends
him
up
to
the
spare
bedroom
in
the
attic
for
the
night
.
on
his
way
up
the
stairs
,
he
tells
her
that
"
families
suck
"
and
that
he
hopes
never
to
see
any
of
his
family
again
.
that
night
the
power
goes
out
,
knocking
out
the
alarm
clocks
,
so
the
mcalisters
wake
up
in
a
big
hurry
to
get
to
the
airport
.
in
a
surprisingly
plausible
setup
,
kevin
is
mistakenly
accounted
for
,
and
the
family
heads
off
without
him
.
it
'
s
interesting
that
,
in
a
subtle
way
,
his
parents
never
noticed
him
missing
because
of
their
deliberate
desire
to
separate
themselves
from
their
children
.
first
they
delegate
the
headcount
to
an
older
sibling
,
and
second
,
they
put
all
the
kids
in
coach
while
they
fly
first
class
.
they
'
re
two
-
thirds
of
the
way
across
the
atlantic
before
they
realize
they
are
missing
a
child
.
meanwhile
,
kevin
believes
that
somehow
his
wish
has
come
true
.
he
'
s
finally
rid
of
his
family
!
life
is
a
dream
come
true
.
he
can
jump
on
the
beds
,
watch
r
-
rated
movies
,
eat
gobs
of
ice
cream
and
potato
chips
,
and
dig
through
his
big
brother
'
s
secret
box
.
slowly
,
the
novelty
wears
off
and
he
settles
into
the
mundane
.
he
grooms
himself
,
he
does
the
laundry
,
he
goes
shopping
(
"
i
bought
some
milk
,
eggs
,
and
fabric
softener
"
)
.
he
also
starts
to
miss
his
family
,
not
just
for
their
company
,
but
for
the
security
they
bring
.
the
furnace
in
the
basement
is
a
scary
monster
,
the
old
man
next
door
is
a
snow
-
shovel
murderer
,
and
two
crooks
are
trying
to
break
into
his
house
.
macaulay
culkin
is
cute
but
he
isn
'
t
much
of
an
actor
.
still
,
we
can
see
that
kevin
'
s
character
grows
,
thanks
to
some
good
direction
and
editing
.
for
example
,
acting
has
little
to
do
with
the
emotional
impact
of
the
scene
where
kevin
searches
out
a
seasonal
santa
at
night
,
just
as
"
santa
"
is
getting
in
his
car
.
kevin
asks
the
man
to
pass
on
his
request
-
he
wants
his
family
back
-
to
the
real
santa
.
he
learned
how
to
deal
with
the
furnace
.
you
turn
on
the
lights
and
it
'
s
not
so
scary
anymore
.
he
goes
to
a
church
one
evening
and
there
he
sees
the
snow
-
shovel
murderer
,
who
actually
turns
out
to
be
a
nice
man
.
they
talk
about
their
fears
and
kevin
learns
that
age
alone
does
not
make
you
less
afraid
.
finally
,
in
the
last
20
minutes
,
kevin
confronts
his
last
fear
-
the
bandits
,
head
on
(
literally
)
.
this
last
act
is
full
of
violent
comedic
slapstick
,
and
after
the
movie
'
s
genuine
dramatic
setup
,
it
is
dessert
.
it
'
s
a
lot
of
fun
,
and
it
doesn
'
t
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
movie
.
on
the
whole
,
home
alone
is
a
great
holiday
movie
.
john
williams
'
original
score
has
the
sound
and
feel
of
holiday
music
without
the
disadvantage
of
being
overplayed
at
the
malls
,
and
the
christmas
setting
can
put
you
in
the
mood
for
those
family
gatherings
.
but
it
does
have
its
flaws
.
the
smallest
problem
is
that
culkin
doesn
'
t
act
very
well
.
as
i
said
before
,
he
is
cute
,
but
repeated
viewings
reveal
more
about
how
columbus
covered
himself
than
about
culkin
'
s
insight
into
his
character
.
the
biggest
problem
is
that
during
the
cartoony
coda
,
the
villains
threaten
kevin
'
s
life
about
five
times
.
instead
of
"
i
'
m
gonna
get
that
kid
"
they
say
"
i
'
m
gonna
kill
that
kid
.
"
some
might
argue
that
the
tone
is
the
same
,
but
i
strongly
disagree
.
mixing
comedy
with
specific
and
viable
threats
of
murder
is
a
sociopathic
faux
-
pas
.
i
'
ll
probably
never
see
home
alone
3
,
and
i
wish
i
had
skipped
home
alone
2
,
but
i
do
enjoy
home
alone
almost
every
year
.
don
'
t
let
your
impressions
of
the
others
detract
from
the
original
,
which
has
much
more
to
offer
than
cartoon
slapstick

quick
and
easy
review
:
i
really
enjoyed
matinee
.
the
mixture
of
comedy
and
tension
blended
nicely
.
unlike
many
comedies
this
film
tries
,
and
succeeds
,
in
getting
past
the
stage
of
doing
anything
for
a
laugh
.
the
makers
of
the
film
also
cared
about
telling
an
intelligent
story
.
the
performances
of
all
the
principals
are
right
on
the
mark
,
particularly
john
goodman
as
the
schlock
master
.
so
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
film
to
anyone
looking
for
a
light
hearted
,
yet
interesting
way
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
.
longer
,
more
detailed
review
:
[
beware
of
spoilers
]
the
primary
reason
i
enjoyed
this
film
was
,
that
while
being
a
comedy
,
the
film
also
had
an
intelligent
story
to
tell
.
too
many
comedies
today
subscribe
to
the
the
notion
that
a
comedy
need
only
make
you
laugh
.
you
watch
the
movie
,
laugh
a
lot
,
leave
the
theatre
and
take
nothing
with
you
.
matinee
is
not
like
that
.
i
left
the
picture
thinking
about
what
i
would
do
faced
with
the
cuban
missile
crisis
.
i
found
myself
wondering
what
would
happen
to
the
characters
of
the
film
.
but
most
importantly
,
i
found
myself
caring
about
what
would
happen
to
the
characters
.
the
comedy
of
the
film
centers
around
goodman
,
his
character
,
and
the
film
he
brings
to
key
west
.
i
believe
that
goodman
is
one
of
the
finest
comedic
actors
in
the
business
today
.
he
is
highly
expressive
both
physically
and
vocally
.
i
felt
he
at
least
deserved
an
oscar
nomination
for
his
work
in
barton
fink
.
the
other
characters
are
often
lost
in
a
scene
with
him
due
to
his
commanding
nature
,
however
,
while
the
star
,
goodman
is
actually
not
at
the
center
of
the
film
.
the
movie
is
really
the
story
of
the
four
teenagers
,
discovering
who
they
are
and
what
they
want
,
against
a
background
where
at
any
minute
it
could
all
end
.
i
thought
the
kids
reaction
were
highly
realistic
.
they
tried
to
block
it
out
,
they
tried
to
escape
from
the
concerns
of
their
world
.
unfortunately
it
kept
creeping
back
in
,
particularly
with
the
fear
,
and
the
chaos
of
the
time
.
while
the
comedy
centered
on
goodman
,
and
the
drama
on
the
teens
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
overlap
.
several
aspects
of
the
panic
are
shown
in
a
humorous
light
.
one
example
is
a
scene
where
people
are
fighting
each
other
for
the
the
last
cans
and
boxes
of
food
in
a
grocery
store
.
if
you
think
about
it
the
threat
of
nuclear
annihilation
seems
hardly
to
be
the
backdrop
for
a
comedy
,
but
it
works
here
.
another
reason
i
like
this
film
is
that
i
like
b
-
science
fiction
movies
.
one
of
my
favorite
films
to
go
watch
is
plan
9
from
outer
space
.
(
note
i
did
not
say
it
was
one
of
my
favorite
movies
,
but
one
of
my
favorite
to
see
.
)
while
mant
!
never
got
made
,
many
films
like
it
were
,
and
mant
!
serves
mostly
as
dante
'
s
homage
to
the
b
-
films
he
loves
.
so
again
i
would
like
to
recommend
matinee
to
anybody
looking
for
a
good
,
humorous
story
.
this
isn
'
t
a
gag
film
like
many
other
comedies
but
an
intelligent
,
well
-
thought
out
,
film
about
real
people
with
real
problems
told
in
an
often
hilarious
way
.
enjoy
!
when
_star
wars_
came
out
some
twenty
years
ago
,
the
image
of
traveling
throughout
the
stars
has
become
a
commonplace
image
.
when
the
millenium
falcon
moves
throughout
the
stars
,
we
see
constellations
,
meteor
showers
,
and
cool
space
-
ships
.
when
han
solo
goes
light
speed
,
the
stars
change
to
bright
lines
,
going
towards
the
viewer
in
lines
that
converge
at
an
invisible
point
.
cool
.
_october
sky_
offers
a
much
simpler
image
--
that
of
a
single
white
dot
,
traveling
horizontally
across
the
night
sky
.
was
it
really
only
forty
years
ago
,
when
sputnik
was
launched
,
and
that
before
then
,
no
satellites
ever
existed
?
have
we
become
so
technologically
advanced
that
we
have
forgotten
that
it
was
nearly
two
generations
ago
where
people
stood
outside
to
breathlessly
see
a
then
-
technological
achievement
,
even
though
it
was
from
the
russians
?
it
sounds
hokey
,
but
when
that
scene
occurs
near
the
beginning
of
_october
sky_
,
i
found
myself
caught
up
with
the
enthusiasm
of
homer
hickam
,
played
by
jake
gyllenhaal
.
determined
to
make
a
dent
in
the
space
race
,
he
becomes
transfixed
with
his
desire
to
make
a
rocket
that
could
fly
like
the
best
of
them
.
it
is
films
like
this
that
we
know
the
ending
as
we
buy
the
ticket
.
when
lovely
teacher
miss
riley
(
played
by
laura
dern
)
,
suggests
that
he
enters
his
findings
into
the
national
science
fair
,
we
know
exactly
who
is
going
to
win
.
but
the
joy
in
a
film
like
this
is
in
the
little
details
.
for
example
,
homer
is
clearly
not
the
strongest
student
in
his
class
.
if
he
has
any
strengths
whatsoever
,
it
is
an
undeterring
vision
,
and
a
good
organizer
.
it
means
that
he
may
have
to
lose
his
reputation
by
associating
with
the
nerdiest
kid
in
school
,
who
knows
more
about
rocket
science
than
he
does
.
it
means
that
if
his
father
forbids
him
to
shoot
rockets
on
company
property
(
that
is
,
the
entire
coal
-
mining
town
)
,
he
must
walk
eight
miles
one
way
,
just
to
set
up
the
rockets
,
which
will
fail
,
fail
,
fail
,
and
fail
again
.
homer
+
s
dad
is
played
by
chris
cooper
,
a
favorite
actor
of
mine
since
_lone
star_
.
here
he
plays
the
antithesis
of
the
character
he
played
in
_matewan_
:
instead
of
organizing
union
rallies
,
he
is
the
head
of
the
coal
-
miners
,
who
is
constantly
wringing
his
hands
against
the
unions
.
this
is
will
be
one
of
the
great
unnoticed
performances
of
the
year
:
note
how
multi
-
dimensional
his
character
is
.
he
is
his
son
+
s
last
nemesis
,
as
one
who
most
likely
interferes
with
his
son
+
s
dreams
.
but
he
truly
loves
his
son
,
and
wants
to
see
him
succeed
the
only
way
he
knows
how
.
through
coal
-
mining
.
because
of
his
character
,
we
can
see
how
far
we
+
ve
come
.
the
revolution
of
modern
technology
has
allowed
for
us
to
see
society
advanced
at
a
rate
far
faster
than
any
generation
before
us
.
we
don
+
t
understand
that
there
were
the
generations
from
the
industrial
revolution
who
knew
of
no
other
way
to
raise
a
family
.
the
paradigm
was
shifting
under
the
father
+
s
feet
,
and
he
knew
of
no
other
life
.
so
_october
sky_
,
far
from
being
merely
a
feel
-
good
inspirational
film
,
offers
much
food
for
thought
.
and
this
is
the
best
type
of
inspirational
film
;
the
one
that
you
take
something
with
you
.
btw
,
the
final
image
of
the
film
is
just
as
simple
,
is
as
strong
a
contrast
as
the
aforementioned
horizontal
-
moving
white
dot
against
the
night
-
sky
background
.
another
commonplace
image
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
must
have
been
breathtaking
forty
years
ago
.

i
'

not

i
didn

like
it
.
what
i
'
m
saying
is
the
first
half
was
extremely
slow
.
now
seeing
the
trailer
it
makes
you
think
the
whole
entire
movie
is
one
big
special

show
.
don
'

be
fooled
,
this
movie
has
a
big
story
.
and
big
chunks
of
talky
moments
.
but
i
will
admit
the
special
effects
and
the
acting
were
above
par
,
deserving
the
rating
above
.
ok
now
to
the
story
.
well
this
may
take
a
while
.
ok
first
of
all
,
our
world
we
live
in
now
,
is
not
the
real
world
,
actually
we
live
inside
a
computer
generated
world
known
as
the
matrix
.
a
man
played
by
keanu
reeves
is
about
to
find
that
out
,
when
is
kidnapped
and
almost
coaxed
to
go
into
the
real
world
.
he
does
so
,
and
finds
out
that
he
can
do
anything
,
be
anything
he
wants
to
be
.
but
he
has
to
fight
a
'
matrix
skipping
'
bad
guy
,
who
wants
to
send
him
back
to
his
own
world
or
destroy
him
.
laurence
fishburne
,
his
guide
of
sorts
plays
his
character
well
as
does
keanu
reeves
.
but
i
sat
in
the
theatre
for
over
and
hour
wondering
where
all
the
special
effects
were
.
yeah
there
were
some
in
the
first
half
but
not
enough
.
the
trailer
for
this
movie
was
really
decieving
making
people
think
that
this
was
a
special
effects
laden
movie
.
now
for
the
second
half
,
it
is
explosive
,
and
saves
the
movie
.
some
of
the
special
effects
and
fighting
were
breathtaking
.
the
sound
,
the
music
,
and
all
the
effects
were
effective
,
and
the
last
hour
kept
us
entertained
.
but
with
a
running
time
of
2
hours
and
20
minutes
,
this
movie
is
at
least
40
minutes
too
long
.
one
would
have
wished
for
a
better
'
matrix
'
,
but
i
do
have
to
say
,
i
did
like
it
and
i
was
entertained

,

evidenced
in

radically
different
projects
currently

--
john

'
s

.
damon
has
his
first
major
starring

,
a
la
mcconaughey
,
in
a
john
grisham
adaptation
--
in
this
case
,
francis
ford
coppola
'
s
take
on
the
rainmaker
.
damon
plays
wet

the

attorney
rudy
baylor
,
who
,
immediately
after
passing
the
bar
exam
,
finds
himself
representing
the
mother
(
mary
kay
place
)
of
a
terminally
ill
young
man
(
john
whitworth
)
in
a
big
-
league
suit
against
a
negligent
insurance
company
.
while
rudy
'
s
(
and
the
film
'
s
)
main
concern
is
this
case
,
he
also
finds
time
to
protect
a
young
wife
(

)
from
her
abusive
husband

melrose
placer
andrew
shue
,
in
a
mercifully
brief
role
)
.
written
for
the
screen
and
directed
by
coppola
,
the
rainmaker
is
the
best
grisham
film
yet
mostly
because
it
does
not
take
itself
too
seriously
.
coppola
'
s
most
notable
--
and
effective
--
contribution
to
the
tried
-
and
-
true
grisham
formula
is
a
sense
of
humor
about
itself
,
which
largely
comes
in
the
presence
of
danny
devito
(
as
rudy
'
s
unlicensed
co
-
counsel
)
and
golden
globe
nominee
jon
voight
(
as
the
insurance
company
'
s
hotshot
attorney
)
.
the
inclusion
of
the
battered
wife
subplot
feels
rather
superfluous
,
but
danes
is
as
superb
as
always
.
then
,
of
course
,
there
is
damon
,
who
nicely
juggles
the
weighty
(
the
insurance
case
,
the
spousal
abuse
)
and
the
humorous
(
rudy
'
s
often
comical
naivete
)
requirements
of
his
role
without
missing
a
beat
.
as
good
as
he
is
in
the
rainmaker
,
damon
showcases
the
depth
of
his
talent
in
good
will
hunting
,
directed
by
gus
van
sant
and
written
by
actor
ben
affleck
and
damon
himself
.
damon
plays
the
title
character
,
will
hunting
,
a
troubled
young
construction
worker
/
janitor
at
mit
who
also
happens
to
be
a
supergenius
.
in
an
attempt
to
steer
this
brilliant
young
mind
in
the
right
direction
,
an
mit
math
professor
(
stellan
skarsgard
)
taps
his
old
college
friend
,
community
college
psychologist
sean
mcguire
(
robin
williams
)
,
to
counsel
the
abrasive
,
standoffish
will
and
try
to
help
him
come
to
terms
with
his
turbulent
life
.
good
will
hunting
is
the
touchy
-
feely
enterprise
its
plot
synopsis
suggests
,
but
to
simply
dismiss
it
as
that
would
be
to
discount
the
true
emotional
chords
affleck
and
damon
'
s
intelligent
script
touches
.
even
though
no
one
(
and
,
if
so
,
_very_
few
people
)
can
directly
relate
to
will
'
s
burden
of
superhuman
intelligence
,
the
insecurities
he
suffers
are
universal
.
the
material
is
brought
to
life
by
the
terrific
ensemble
of
actors
.
williams
delivers
a
nice
dramatic
turn
;
affleck
,
a
hot
up
-
and
-
coming
actor
himself
(
chasing
amy
)
,
turns
up
in
a
warm
and
charming
performance
as
will
'
s
best
friend
;
and
the
ever
-
appealing
minnie
driver
shines
as
will
'
s
harvard
-
schooled
love
interest
.
the
clear
standout
in
the
cast
,
though
,
is
damon
,
who
bravely
does
not
soften
will
'
s
prickly
nature
but
has
such
a
natural
ease
with
the
audience
that
it
is
hard
_not_
to
care
for
him
.
so
many
names
come
and
go
with
the
fluctuations
of
the
hollywood
hype
machine
,
but
based
on
his
impressive
work
in
john
grisham
'
s
the
rainmaker
and
especially
good
will
hunting
,
it
is
a
safe
bet
that
matt
damon
is
one
name
we
will
be
hearing
a
lot
more
of
in
the
years
to
come
.

wife
.
leonard
has
only
a
few
clues
to
the
murderer
'
s
identity
;
to
make
matters
worse
,
he
suffers
from
a
condition
which
inhibits
the
creation
of
short
-
term
memories
,
meaning
that
leonard
is
always
forgetting
what
happened
just
minutes
earlier
.
because
of
this
,
leonard
is
forced
to
rely
on
notes
he
leaves
for
himself

the

from
its
apparent
culmination
.
review
:
"
memento
"
is
the
sort
of
movie
i
wish
i
'
d
written
;
i
can
think
of
no
higher
praise
than
that
.
i
am
envious
that
nolan
has
concocted
such
a
brilliant
,
involved
,
original
movie
as
this
.
an
instant
film
noir
classic
,
"
memento
"
is
virtually
flawless
.
the
script
is
unlike
any
i
have
ever
seen
--
a
notable
achievement
in
these
days
of
recycled
hollywood
homogeneity
.
although
the
idea
of
starting
at
the
"
conclusion
"
of
the
plotline
and
then
moving
backward
in
time
to
the
"
start
"
is
not
entirely
new
,
never
before
have
i
witnessed
it
executed
with
such
flair
and
coherence
.
"
memento
"
is
endlessly
exciting
and
inventive
,
a
rare
story
which
keeps
the
viewers
guessing
during
the
film
itself
,
and
mulling
over
its
connotations
long
after
leaving
the
theatre
.
and
it
is
not
merely
an
exercise
in
cerebrality
;
there
is
plenty
of
action
and
an
unexpected
dose
of
humour
to
keep
the
proceedings
lively
.
nolan
'
s
direction
is
equally
effective
,
never
losing
its
crispness
and
clarity
despite
"
memento
"
'
s
challenging
gimmick
.
and
to
top
everything
off
,
all
the
performances
rise
to
the
occasion
.
pierce
is
terrific
as
the
troubled
leonard
;
moss
shows
great
range
as
enigmatic
natalie
;
and
pantoliano
'
s
teddy
achieves
a
splendidly
affable
yet
sinister
quality
.
"
memento
"
may
be
the
year
'
s
best
screenplay
,
and
is
certainly
amongst
the
top
theatrical
attractions
of
2001
.
earth
is
a
harsh
,
unconsoling
drama
about
the
time
when
india
gained
independence
from
britain
and
the
ensuing
turmoil
that
engulfed
the
subcontinent
.
people
who
supposedly
loved
the
same
land
and
the
same
god
found
themselves
in
bitter
conflict
,
as
the
country
divided
into
factions
fighting
in
the
streets
:
indian
and
pakistani
;
muslim
,
hindu
,
sikh
,
parsee
.
the
story
takes
place
in
lahore
,
which
was
indian
before
partition
,
and
pakistani
afterward
,
regardless
of
what
its
citizens
might
call
themselves
.
the
action
is
seen
through
the
eyes
of
lenny
(
maaia
sethna
)
,
a
young
parsee
girl
,
but
it
is
really
about
her
nanny
,
shanta
.
shanta
has
a
small
circle
of
male
admirers
.
two
of
the
men
are
suitors
:
hasan
(
rahul
khanna
)
,
a
hindu
,
and
dil
navaz
(
aamir
khan
)
,
a
muslim
.
the
others
--
sikh
,
hindu
,
muslim
--
are
older
;
some
are
married
;
but
all
appreciate
shanta
,
who
is
played
by
the
stirringly
beautiful
nandita
das
.
(
she
also
starred
in
deepa
mehta
'
s
previous
film
,
fire
,
the
first
part
of
a
thematic
trilogy
which
will
conclude
with
water
.
)
in
an
early
scene
,
the
men
are
sitting
in
a
park
talking
with
shanta
and
lenny
;
political
tension
in
the
country
is
growing
as
the
day
of
independence
nears
.
one
of
the
men
remarks
,
jokingly
,
that
their
little
group
is
probably
one
of
the
last
places
in
the
city
where
the
different
religions
can
still
get
along
.
he
is
wrong
:
the
men
make
barbed
little
comments
to
each
other
,
spoken
like
jokes
,
but
with
an
undercurrent
of
fanaticism
.
the
tenor
of
these
exchanges
grows
darker
and
more
bitter
as
the
movie
progresses
.
it
is
easy
to
perceive
,
in
these
squabbles
,
the
trajectory
which
ends
in
mass
violence
and
slaughter
.
the
group
around
shanta
represents
,
in
a
sense
,
a
united
india
,
and
shanta
herself
the
ideal
motherland
--
one
which
all
love
,
which
inspires
hindu
,
muslim
,
and
sikh
to
live
peacably
together
.
but
the
circle
around
shanta
is
sundered
,
as
is
the
state
.
a
sikh
is
persecuted
,
hides
,
then
flees
.
another
man
is
murdered
.
the
group
of
friends
will
not
meet
again
.
the
movie
is
rife
with
images
of
breakage
and
destruction
:
a
plate
shattered
on
the
floor
,
a
stuffed
toy
torn
apart
by
an
upset
child
,
and
,
most
brutally
,
when
the
tension
escalates
into
violence
,
a
man
is
held
down
,
tied
between
two
cars
,
and
ripped
in
half
by
the
opposing
movement
of
the
vehicles
.
it
is
a
visceral
and
effective
metaphor
for
a
country
which
is
being
destroyed
just
as
painfully
.
the
crux
of
earth
'
s
plot
is
the
transformation
undergone
by
dil
navaz
.
his
sisters
are
killed
in
brutal
fashion
,
by
hindus
,
because
they
are
muslim
.
dil
navaz
seeks
solace
from
shanta
,
and
asks
in
desperation
that
she
marry
him
.
but
she
loves
hasan
,
and
tenderly
refuses
dil
navaz
'
s
offer
.
the
combination
of
familial
anguish
and
romantic
rejection
twists
inside
him
,
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
he
is
seduced
by
the
growing
mob
mentality
:
the
muslim
cause
gives
him
a
motive
to
vent
his
anger
and
hate
.
despite
the
things
he
later
does
,
it
is
to
the
credit
of
earth
that
it
does
not
simply
denounce
dil
navaz
and
those
like
him
,
but
shows
how
circumstances
can
make
decent
enough
men
do
monstrous
things
.
the
conclusion
--
the
consequence
of
dil
navaz
'
s
transformation
--
is
rather
abrupt
.
the
story
earth
tells
does
not
end
.
it
just
stops
.
it
is
an
appropriate
finish
:
giving
us
closure
would
have
imparted
,
at
least
on
an
aesthetic
level
,
a
sense
of
resolution
,
of
satisfaction
.
but
there
was
no
resolution
for
india
and
pakistan
--
they
have
been
at
war
,
on
a
small
or
large
scale
,
for
decades
.
since
the
personal
dramas
in
earth
mirror
the
political
struggles
of
a
nation
,
it
is
only
right
that
those
dramas
should
have
no
terminus
.
there
is
no
healing
to
be
had
,
no
closure
,
on
any
level
(
despite
the
needless
,
tacked
-
on
ending
,
with
voice
-
over
narration
from
lenny
as
an
adult
,
framing
the
story
)
.
earth
is
,
in
some
ways
,
an
unexceptional
movie
.
it
does
not
reinvent
the
wheel
,
following
instead
the
standard
pattern
of
historical
dramas
.
but
deepa
mehta
'
s
directon
is
assured
,
and
the
issues
she
addresses
run
deep
.
earth
does
for
india
what
movies
like
zhang
yimou
'
s
to
live
and
tian
zhuangzhuang
'
s
the
blue
kite
did
for
china
:
they
show
us
the
agonies
endured
by
unremarkable
people
who
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
caught
up
and
smashed
in
the
crucible
of
history
.
such
films
strike
me
as
inherently
valuable
,
even
when
flawed
.
they
may
be
biased
or
inaccurate
,
but
they
bear
the
weight
of
human
hardship
,
and
this
confers
on
them
a
nobility
and
gravity
which
other
,
more
inventive
films
,
often
lack
.
it
is
notable
that
all
three
movies
were
banned
in
their
native
countries
:
the
events
shown
may
have
happened
decades
ago
,
but
they
still
touch
a
nerve
.
the
issues
tackled
in
earth
have
a
particular
urgency
in
light
of
the
nuclear
test
bombings
that
took
place
last
year
.
in
the
near
future
,
india
and
pakistan
may
launch
nuclear
missiles
at
each
other
.
at
the
time
of
the
tests
i
had
some
understanding
of
the
reasons
why
this
might
happen
;
after
seeing
earth
,
i
have
a
much
,
much
better
understanding
.
up
until
about
a
year
ago
,
john
travolta
'
s
career
consisted
of
those
"
look
who
'
s
talking
"
movies
(
notice
how
they
never
called
them
look
who
'
s
talented
)
and
the
1991
bomb
shout
(
which
was
bad
enough
to
make
most
people
scream
)
.
but
somewhere
along
the
line
,
travolta
got
the
starring
role
in
the
tarantino
masterpiece
pulp
fiction
and
his
career
soared
once
again
.
weird
how
someone
whose
career
was
on
par
with
the
bee
gees
back
in
1978
would
experience
fame
and
fortune
once
again
,
while
barry
,
robin
and
maurice
gibb
could
do
no
better
than
a
1993
straight
-
to
-
the
-
cutout
-
bin
album
aptly
named
"
size
isn
'
t
everything
"
(
and
of
course
,
they
learned
that
sales
are
everything
)
.
but
now
travolta
'
s
back
on
the
hollywood
scene
once
again
,
and
i
think
we
all
know
why
.
four
words
:
contract
with
the
devil
.
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
newt
gingrich
'
s
"
contract
with
america
.
"
no
,
satan
is
much
more
humane
.
anyway
,
yes
,
travolta
has
sold
his
soul
to
the
hairy
host
of
the
netherworld
.
how
do
i
know
?
i
own
the
document
in
question
.
amazing
what
you
can
buy
at
those
collector
'
s
shops
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
,
isn
'
t
it
?
get
shorty
continues
in
the
vein
of
pulp
fiction
,
with
travolta
as
crime
minion
chili
palmer
.
he
goes
to
collect
some
of
the
mafia
'
s
money
from
a
b
-
grade
director
(
gene
hackman
)
and
suddenly
finds
out
he
wants
out
of
the
mob
game
and
into
the
movie
game
.
sure
,
a
ruthless
criminal
like
him
is
far
too
honest
to
make
it
in
hollywood
,
but
i
guess
that
'
s
beside
the
point
.
palmer
is
determined
to
get
hackman
'
s
next
project
made
,
so
he
sets
out
to
convince
big
star
martin
weir
(
danny
devito
)
to
star
in
the
movie
,
bringing
along
down
-
and
-
out
horror
actress
karen
flores
(
rene
russo
)
,
who
has
already
had
affairs
with
hackman
and
devito
.
it
doesn
'
t
take
a
las
vegas
odds
-
maker
to
predict
that
she
and
travolta
will
soon
be
hitting
the
sheets
as
well
,
after
the
customary
sexual
tension
and
denial
,
which
has
been
used
in
every
comedy
from
"
who
'
s
the
boss
?
"
to
speechless
.
it
works
in
this
case
,
unlike
"
who
'
s
the
boss
?
"
although
it
'
s
interesting
to
note
that
tony
danza
has
signed
a
contract
with
the
devil
also
.
complicating
matters
somewhat
are
the
mobsters
who
have
backed
hackman
'
s
other
films
and
want
in
on
this
one
too
,
along
with
travolta
'
s
mob
boss
trying
to
track
him
down
for
defecting
.
get
shorty
is
by
no
means
on
the
same
level
as
pulp
fiction
,
despite
the
obvious
similarities
.
this
movie
doesn
'
t
have
near
the
amount
of
originality
or
depth
as
pulp
fiction
but
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
entertaining
movies
i
'
ve
seen
this
year
(
yes
,
even
better
than
halloween
vi
)
.
get
shorty
is
my
kind
of
movie
,
one
that
mixes
intelligent
humor
with
action
and
violence
.
i
'
m
definitely
going
to
have
to
check
out
the
novel
it
was
based
on
.
are
you
getting
this
,
shorty
?
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
attend
an
advance
screening
for
the
upcoming
thriller
conspiracy
theory
.
this
was
,
of
course
,
a
big
deal
for
me
because
reviewing
movies
is
basically
just
a
hobby
for
me
and
i
never
get
a
chance
at
something
like
this
.
not
only
did
i
get
to
see
an
advance
screening
,
i
was
able
to
see
an
advance
screening
of
a
*
very
good
*
movie
.
the
very
fast
-
paced
film
stars
mel
gibson
as
jerry
fletcher
,
a
fast
-
talking
,
witty
,
comical
taxi
driver
in
new
york
city
.
gibson
'
s
performance
is
terrific
,
and
his
character
is
similar
to
that
of
martin
riggs
in
the
lethal
weapon
films
.
gibson
again
teams
up
with
richard
donner
,
as
he
did
in
the
lethal
weapon
films
and
maverick
,
and
this
time
around
,
the
combination
works
even
better
.
the
character
of
jerry
fletcher
is
indeed
unique
.
try
to
imagine
a
toned
-
downed
version
of
travis
bickle
who
,
this
time
around
,
is
a
jittery
guy
with
knowledge
of
government
conspiracy
cover
-
ups
.
if
you
can
imagine
that
,
then
you
'
ve
basically
got
jerry
fletcher
.
in
many
ways
,
i
was
surprised
by
this
movie
.
to
begin
with
,
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
it
was
.
don
'
t
get
me
wrong
,
it
'
s
not
going
to
be
accepting
any
gold
trophies
next
spring
,
but
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
movie
.
secondly
,
i
was
surprised
at
mel
gibson
'
s
performance
.
he
provided
a
fantastic
performance
.
the
previews
of
this
film
led
me
to
believe
it
was
an
all
-
out
action
flick
,
which
after
viewing
,
it
was
almost
the
opposite
in
a
certain
sense
.
gibson
'
s
character
has
an
almost
uncountable
number
of
one
-
liners
,
hilarious
situations
,
and
his
character
is
one
that
the
audience
tends
to
side
with
throughout
the
film
.
for
instance
,
jerry
'
s
apartment
(
and
especially
his
security
)
is
memorable
.
and
last
,
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
the
plot
is
.
writer
brian
helgeland
has
created
a
terrific
story
,
and
when
watching
this
film
,
you
are
left
to
wonder
if
all
of
jerry
fletcher
'
s
far
-
fetched
(
or
so
they
seem
at
first
)
conspiracy
theories
are
helgeland
'
s
own
opinions
.
mel
gibson
isn
'
t
the
only
stand
-
out
in
the
film
.
julia
roberts
is
very
good
in
her
performance
as
alice
sutton
,
the
department
of
justice
employee
who
can
'
t
seem
to
stay
away
from
jerry
fletcher
,
who
continually
visits
alice
in
hopes
that
she
will
do
something
about
his
theories
.
he
also
seems
obsessed
and
in
love
with
her
.
but
whenever
he
approaches
her
with
another
one
of
his
theories
,
she
shrugs
him
and
his
beliefs
off
,
continually
noting
that
one
day
she
is
going
to
slap
a
restraining
order
on
him
.
jerry
,
obviously
determined
to
continually
seek
out
the
truth
,
continues
to
research
information
for
his
next
conspiracy
theory
,
which
will
be
printed
in
his
newsletter
(
same
title
as
the
movie
)
.
although
he
only
has
five
subscribers
,
he
puts
a
large
amount
of
time
and
effort
into
his
work
,
and
publishes
his
next
edition
.
very
soon
after
he
does
so
,
he
is
abducted
and
tortured
by
a
sinister
man
who
refers
to
himself
as
dr
.
jonas
(
patrick
stewart
)
.
after
barely
escaping
alive
,
jerry
is
forced
to
turn
to
the
only
person
he
can
trust
:
alice
sutton
.
the
remainder
of
the
film
is
almost
always
fast
-
paced
and
full
of
action
and
suspense
,
with
jerry
'
s
life
being
constantly
put
into
jeopardy
.
and
more
along
the
way
,
the
audience
(
and
alice
)
learn
more

the

of
the

the

story
,
"
shrek

follows
several
momentous
days
in
the
life
of
the
title
character
,
a
rotund
green
ogre
voiced
by
mike
myers
in
that
pleasant
scottish
accent
he
is
so
fond
of
using
.
shrek
is
a
grumpy
fellow
living
a
solitary
life
deep
in
the
swamp
,
until
a
local
nobleman
disturbs
his
peace
.
petty
tyrant
lord
farquaad
(

for

characters
when
he
banishes
the
fanciful
beings
from

as
a
result
,
shrek
finds
himself
surrounded
by
legends
like
the

,

,
the
big
bad
wolf
,
the

,
and

an
enraged

storms
to

only
to
find

(
john
lithgow
)
ready
to
bargain
.
lord
obnoxious
wants
to
become
king
and
the
magic
mirror
from
"
snow
white
"
has
shown
him
the
way
.
all
he
has
to
do
is
rescue
a
damsel
in
distress
and
make
her
his
wife
.
the
mirror
unveils
three
choices
in
a
presentation
straight
out
of

"
(
when

is

,
"
even
though

she
'

)
farquaad
selects
the
lovely
princess
fiona
(
cameron

)
and
offers
shrek
a
deal
:
if
the
ogre
snatches

-
filled

she
is

brings
her
to

throne
,
the
lord
will
allow
the
fairy
tale
pests
to
move
back
on

grounds
.
shrek
reluctantly
agrees
and
sets
off
on
his
quest
,
accompanied
by
a
motor
-
mouthed
donkey
(
eddie

)
determined
to
make
the
green
grump
his
best
friend
.
they
finally
hook
up
with
the
princess
,
only
to
learn
she
is
not
the
helpless
maiden
they
expected
to
meet
.
for
the
matter
,
the
dragon
offers
a
few
surprises
as
well
.
the
movie
references
a
great
many
other
flicks
,
from
"
babe
"
(
"
that
'
ll
do
,
donkey
.
that
'
ll
do
"
)
to
"
the
graduate
.
"
but
the
lion
'
s
share
of
the
jokes
come
at
the
expense
of
the
wonderful
world
of
disney
.
the
public
-
domain
characters
made
into
icons
in
various
disney
films
take
their
hits
?
pinocchio
is
referred
to
as
a
"
possessed
toy
"
and
when
shrek
spies
a
sleeping
snow
white
in
his
cabin
,
he
bellows
,
"
get
that
dead
broad
off
the
table
!
"
?
but
the
biggest
slams
come
when
shrek
visits
farquaad
'
s
royal
domicile
,
which
closely
resembles
a
certain
magic
kingdom
,
from
its
souvenir
stands
and
queue
lines
to
a
display
of
animatronic
figures
that
sing
the
palace
rules
in
a
relentlessly
peppy
tune
that
sounds
a
lot
like
"
it
'
s
a
small
world
.
"
which
brings
me
to
disturbing
point
number
one
.
i
laughed
at
all
the
disney
swipes
,
but
found
the
mentality
behind
them
a
bit
sad
.
the
acrimony
between
dreamworks
honcho
jeff
katzenberg
and
disney
big
wheel
michael
eisner
is
well
known
.
for
years
the
two
companies
have
tried
to
sabotage
each
other
'
s
film
and
video
releases
by
issuing
similar
competing
productions
on
the
same
day
.
and
now
we
have
katzenberg
using
an
entire
movie
to
attack
his
former
employer
.
here
'
s
a
suggestion
for
the
two
boys
:
grow
up
!
put
the
past
behind
you
!
there
'
s
room
in
the
sandbox
for
both
of
you
and
if
you
farquaads
can
'
t
play
nice
,
then
go
to
your
rooms
!
the
other
area
i
found
troubling
came
in
the
portrayal
of
lord
farquaad
.
beyond
all
the
irreverence
,
"
shrek
"
actually
has
a
message
:
people
should
learn
to
look
beyond
physical
appearances
,
because
true
beauty
lies
within
.
it
'
s
a
lovely
notion
,
but
the
film
betrays
its
own
moral
by
incessantly
taking
cheap
shots
at
farquaad
'
s
diminutive
stature
.
do
we
really
need
a
family
film
reinforcing
the
idea
that
mocking
short
people
is
acceptable
?
the
pompous
,
selfish
behavior
of
farquaad
is
enough
to
make
him
a
target
for
zingers
.
adding
short
jokes
is
simply
mean
.
still
,
"
shrek
"
is
a
rollicking
good
time
.
the
computer
animation
is
mostly
impressive
(
although
several
key
characters
look
like
animated
rubber
squeeze
toys
and
the
human
movements
are
often
jerky
)
,
the
voice
work
is
strong
(
particularly
from
eddie
murphy
)
,
the
laughs
come
fast
and
furious
,
and
the
moral
,
tainted
though
it
may
be
,
is
a
good
one
.
to
trot
out
a
clich
?
,
"
shrek
"
is
fun
for
all
ages
.
parents
,
though
,
should
remind
their
young
ones
during
the
ride
home
that
taunting
others
because
they
are
short
,
tall
,
skinny
,
fat
,
etc
.
is
a
bad
thing
.
after
watching
the
first
ten
minutes
of
this
japanese
film
,
you
will
never
eat
a
bowl
of
ramen
the
same
way
again
.
there
is
a
scene
where
an
old
man
is
teaching
a
young
one
how
to
eat
the
soupy
bowl
of
noodles
,
as
a
master
would
teach
an
eager
apprentice
.
"
you
caress
the
noodles
with
the
chopsticks
,
"
he
says
,
"
then
put
the
roast
pork
on
the
side
of
the
bowl
and
apologize
to
it
by
saying
,
'
see
you
soon
.
'
"
of
course
,
it
'
s
meant
to
be
a
parody
,
but
there
is
an
earnestness
underneath
the
silliness
that
makes
you
take
it
with
a
certain
degree
of
sobriety
.
you
begin
to
appreciate
the
food
as
not
merely
something
you
eat
,
not
something
you
like
,
not
something
you
enjoy
,
but
rather
something
you
experience
.
experiencing
it
is
a
process
which
engages
all
of
the
senses
,
fulfilling
each
one
on
its
own
terms
and
weaving
them
so
that
the
total
is
a
pleasure
that
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
.
trust
me
,
you
really
want
to
go
find
a
noodle
shop
at
this
point
.
juzo
itami
'
s
tampopo
brings
the
same
sense
of
the
serious
parody
of
food
to
the
forefront
by
making
the
story
follow
the
pattern
of
an
american
western
,
set
in
modern
day
japan
.
a
stranger
,
goro
(
tsutomu

,
comes
into

and

,

proprietor
of

,
hole

trying
to
fend
off
the
insults
of
the
local
strongman

pisken
(
rikiya
yasuoka
)
.
goro
,
to
defend
the
honor
of
this
woman
and
her
noodles
,
gets
into
a
fight
with
the
ringleader
and
his
henchmen
,
emerging
bloodied
,
but
victorious
.
goro
finds
that
tampopo
'
s
ambition
is
to
have
a
shop
that
people
would
flock
to
from

,
just
to
eat
a
bowl
of
her
ramen
.
the
problem
is
,
her
fare
is
something
less
than
popular
,
and
less
than
appetizing
.
however
,
goro
agrees
to
help
tampopo
in
her
quest
,
and
in
the
process
they
seek
the
wisdom
of
an
elderly
noodle
expert
,
enlist
the
aid
of
a
wealthy
patron
,
and
make
friends
with
the
former
enemy
.
this
film
is
filled
with
many
little
scenes
which
are
absolute
gems
.
take
,
for
example
,
when
tampopo
tries
to
buy
the
recipe
for
a
delicious
soup
from
another
shop
owner
.
the
price
is
too
high
,
but
the
owner
of
the
store
next
door
will
secretly
sell
it
to
her
for
a
more
affordable
sum
.
tampopo
meets
him
at
his
store
late
at
night
,
and
he
leads
her
to
a
back
room
.
she
protests
,
thinking
that
perhaps
this
man
has
ulterior
motives
,
but
he
insists
.
just
when
she
is
about
to
bolt
for
the
exit
,
he
shows
her
a
small
gap
in
the
wall
adjoining
his
store
with
the
noodle
shop
next
door
.
she
peers
through
and
takes
notes
as
she
watches
the
cook
make
the
soup
for
the
next
day
,
her
face
filled
with
a
joy
that
can
be
felt
by
the
audience
.
this
scene
,
while
comical
,
is
very
effective
at
filling
the
viewer
with
a
sense
of
trepidation
,
then
of
relief
and
discovery
.
there
'
s
also
an
interesting
scene
where
goro
introduces
tampopo
and
her
son
to
a
bunch
of
street
people
who
,
despite
their
economic
trappings
,
are
all
gourmets
and
master
sommeliers
.
we
even
watch
as
one
of
them
sneaks
into
the
kitchen
of
a
restaurant
and
expertly
prepares
a
french
omelet
.
the
scene
is
meant
to
bring
a
laugh
,
but
it
also
says
that
no
matter
whether
people
are
rich
or
poor
,
food
is
something
which
everyone
has
in
common
,
and
the
enjoyment
of
food
is
an
experience
shared
by
all
.
there
are
also
a
number
of
unrelated
vignettes
appearing
throughout
the
film
,
which
help
to
illustrate
and
accentuate
the
role
of
food
in
people
'
s
lives
.
a
particularly
effective
one
involves
a
wife
and
mother
being
tended
to
in
her
home
by
a
doctor
.
surrounded
by
her
children
,
she
is
obviously
in
her
last
hours
of
life
.
her
husband
comes
home
,
and
seeing
her
worsened
condition
,
demands
that
she
get
up
and
make
dinner
.
the
viewer
knows
the
husband
'
s
intention
is
not
to
be
mean
;
he
is
desperate
for
the
normalcy
of
which
he
and
his
family
has
obviously
been
deprived
,
and
the
wife
making
dinner
is
an
essential
part
of
this
.
in
a
near
miracle
,
the
wife
drags
herself
to
the
kitchen
and
prepares
a
quick
meal
,
then
brings
it
to
her
awaiting
family
.
as
the
family
eats
,
she
looks
on
them
and
smiles
.
preparing
food
for
her
family
is
a
joy
and
a
comfort
to
her
,
and
for
a
brief
moment
,
she
too
enjoys
the
normalcy
.
then
she
falls
over
,
dead
.
for
a
moment
,
the
family
is
stunned
,
but
then
the
father
yells
at
the
children
,
"
keep
eating
!
this
is
the
last
meal
your
mother
ever
made
!
"
crying
as
they
do
so
,
the
family
finishes
the
meal
.
the
scene
is
comical
,
awkward
,
moving
,
and
beautiful
.
by
including
the
vignettes
,
itami
ran
the
risk
of
creating
a
disjointed
film
,
but
surprisingly
,
they
do
not
interrupt
the
pacing
of
the
main
storyline
.
instead
,
they
even
help
contribute
to
the
idea
that
tampopo
'
s
goal
of
being
able
to
serve
exceptional
food
is
worthy
and
even
noble
.
because
the
film
parodies
a
western
,
the
construction
of
the
plot
is
fairly
predictable
,
but
is
still
enjoyable
as
we
watch
the
familiar
way
in
which
the
"
good
guys
"
come
together
for
the
final
showdown
.
in
this
case
,
the
showdown
is
against
the
ramen
.
if
they
eat
tampopo
'
s
ramen
,
soup
and
all
,
tampopo
knows
she
has
succeeded
.
it
'
s
pretty
obvious
what
the
outcome
will
be
,
but
when
a
film
changes
your
whole
perspective
on
something
you
consume
every
day
of
your
life
,
you
can
afford
to
cut
it
a
little
slack
.
there
'
s
an
old
saying
that
states
something
about
leaving
the
best
for
last
.
george
lucas
certainly
followed
that
adage
when
crafting
the
original
star
wars
trilogy
.
return
of
the
jedi
,
the
final
installment
of
the
series
,
is
easily
the
most
innovative
,
action
-
packed
,
and
entertaining
of
the
three
films
.
the
dark
,
eerie
atmosphere
that
oozed
from
every
frame
of
the
empire
strikes
back
is
gone
.
instead
,
for
return
of
the
jedi
,
we
have
good
triumphing
decisively
over
evil
,
a
resolution
to
a
love
triangle
,
and
walking
teddy
bears
.
even
darth
vader
doesn
'
t
seem
very
intimidating
this
time
around
.
with
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
(
an
apparition
-
like
creature
played
by
ian
mcdiarmid
)
,
vader
has
turned
into
somewhat
of
a
henchman
.
return
of
the
jedi
picks
up
at
an
unspecified
time
after
the
conclusion
of
the
empire
strikes
back
.

mission
to

of

.
their
goal
:
to
save
han
solo
(
harrison
ford
)
from
the
clutches
of
the
intergalactic
gangster
jabba
the
hutt
.
it
is
at
jabba
'
s
home
,
a
creepy
-
looking
stone
fortress
guarded
by
hog
-
nosed
beasts
,
that
most
of
the
added
special
effects
come
into
play
.
from
a
hysterical
scene
involving
a
music
group
to
the
dreaded
beast
outside
jabba
'
s
sand
barge
,
the
effects
are
top
notch
.
as
soon
as
han
is
freed
from
his
cryo
-
freeze
and
rescued
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
jabba
the
hutt
,
it
'
s
back
to
outer
space
,
where
the
rebel
alliance
is
about
to
face
the
empire
'
s
newest
threat
:
a
second
,
more
powerful
death
star
,
that
,
if
activated
,
could
spell
doom
for
anyone
who
stands
against
the
emperor
.
so
,
while
the
fleet
prepares
for
the
final
battle
,
luke
and
company
travel
to
the
forest
moon
of
endor
to
knock
out
the
shield
that
defends
the
death
star
against
all
attacks
.
there
,
they
are
befriended
by
the
ewoks
,
the
teddy
bear
-
like
native
race
,
and
luke
,
fearing
that
his
presence
is
endangering
the
group
,
turns
himself
over
to
vader
.
return
of
the
jedi
has
some
interesting
elements
.
the
scenes
which
pitted
luke
against
the
emperor
and
vader
are
suitably
tense
and
well
-
acted
.
from
a
technical
point
-
of
-
view
,
the
space
battles
are
amazing
,
easily
hindering
anything
depicted
in
the
previous
films
.
not
only
are
there
many
,
many
more
ships
,
but
their
speed
and
range
of
movement
have
been
dramatically
improved
.
on
one
level
,
return
of
the
jedi
is
almost
worth
watching
for
the
special
effects
.
in
the
special
edition
,
even
more
ships
are
added
,
making
the
final
space
battle
incredibly
fun
to
watch
.
the
acting
in
return
of
the
jedi
is
stronger
than
in
the
previous
films
.
by
now
(
or
then
-
1983
)
,
mark
hamill
,
harrison
ford
,
and
carrie
fisher
have
all
matured
in
their
on
-
screen
personas
.
the
chemistry
amongst
the
trio
is
terrific
.
as
in
empire
,
billy
dee
williams
gives
us
another
human
hero
to
root
for
.
newcomer
ian
mcdiarmid
plays
the
emperor
as
a
suitably
creepy
,
cunning
,
and
evil
creature
,
although
he
'
s
not
as
imposing
as
vader
was
in
star
wars
.
although
it
was
great
fun
watching
star
wars
and
the
empire
strikes
back
on
the
big
screen
,
return
of
the
jedi
generates
a
greater
sense
of
enjoyment
.
with
the
spectacular
,
new
special
effects
,
the
adorable
ewoks
,
the
sinister
jabba
the
hutt
,
the
evil
emperor
,
the
same
old
millenium

,
darth
vader
'
s
incredible
betrayal
,
the
destruction
of
the
new
death
star
,
and
the
always
lovable
yoda
,
return
of
the
jedi
concludes
one
of
the
greatest
trilogies
ever
made
with
a
huge
bang
.
congratulations
to
george
lucas
,
whose
innovative
mind
entertains
us
now
and
will
continue
to
entertain
generations
to
come
.
,
why
do
so
many
children
'
s
films
treat
their
target
audience
with
utter
contempt
?
too
many
of
those
who
write
or
direct
for
children
'
s
movies
assume
that
the
kids
just
can
'
t
handle
serious
,
thoughtful
discussions
on
meaningful
issues
.
"
the
iron
giant
,
"
which
was
directed
and
co
-
written
by
brad
bird
,
late
of
such
animated
series
as
"
the
simpsons
"
and
"
king
of
the
hill
,
"
assumes
that
not
only
can
children
handle
such
discussions
,
but
that
they
can
do
so
while
being
entertained
at
the
same
time
.
"
the
iron
giant
"
holds
absolutely
no
contempt
for
the
young
people
in
the
audience
,
making
it
a
film
that
'
s
enjoyable
for
both
children
and
adults
alike
.
hogarth
hughes
(
voice
of
eli
marienthal
)
is
a
spirited
young
lad
who
lives
with
his
hard
-
working
single
mother
,
annie
(
jennifer
aniston
)
,
in
a
small
town
in
maine
.
after
staying
up
late
and
watching
scary
movies
on
a
night
his
mother
is
away
,
hogarth
treks
out
into
the
forest
to
investigate
what
has
stolen
his
antenna
and
ruined
his
tv
reception
.
he
comes
across
a
giant
robot
(
vin
diesel
)
from
space
that
eats
metal
for
food
.
after
saving
the
robot
,
nicknamed
the
iron
giant
,
from
electric
shock
,
hogarth
befriends
the
creature
and
takes
him
in
as
a
pet
of
sorts
.
because
of
damage
he
suffered
upon
landing
,
the
giant
has
forgotten
what
his
original
mission
was
,
so
he
just
follows
hogarth
around
like
a
lost
puppy
.
realizing
he
can
'
t
just
keep
the
giant
in
a
barn
all
the
time
,
and
that
the
giant
needs
food
,
he
takes
him
to
a
junkyard
owned
by
dean
(
harry
connick
jr
.
)
,
an
eccentric
artist
who
assembles
sculptures
out
of
scrap
iron
in
his
spare
time
.
it
soon
becomes
apparent
that
dean
and
hogarth
can
'
t
keep
the
giant
a
secret
forever
,
because
a
government
spook
named
kent
mansley
(
christopher
mcdonald
)
has
been
brought
in
to
investigate
mysterious
sightings
in
the
surrounding
forest
area
and
considers
the
giant
a
threat
to
national
security
.
he
suspects
hogarth
knows
something
about
the
giant
,
and
takes
up
residence
in
hogarth
'
s
house
as
a
lodger
.
